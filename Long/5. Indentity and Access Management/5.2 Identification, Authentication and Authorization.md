# Identification, Authentication and Authorization

Two categories of access controls are:

* System access controls
  * protect the entire system and provide a first line of defense for the data contained on the system
* Data access controls
  * specifically implemented to protect the data contained on the system

# System access controls
* protect systems and information by restricting access to the system
* can provide complete authentication, authorization, and accountability (AAA), it’s authentication for which they are renowned
* Authentication based on any three factors
  1. Something you know (pw, PIN)
  2. Something you have (smart card, token)
  3. Something you are (fingerprint, retina)

## Identification and authentication
* I&A (Identification and Authentication) techniques: pw, PIN, biometric, SSO...
* Identification 
  * simple mechanism based on username, process, computername, MAC, IP..
  * only requirements are that it must uniquely identify the user
  * no labels like CEO or accounting
  * shared accounts should be avoided
  * act of claiming a spceific identity
* Authentication
  * act of verifying the identity

### Passwords and passphrases
* most common authentication mechanism in use today
* problems
  * insecure, user often choose pw that are easy to remember = easy to guess, and write it down
  * transmission and storage, many protocols (FTP, PAP) transmit pw in clear text or stored in plain text files
  * easily broken with brute force
  * inconvenient, long pw can be tiresome to enter
  * refutable, correct pw doesn't guarantee proof of users id, authentication must provide non-repudiation
* Controls, management features, best practices
  * Length, longer the better, should be minimum 6-8
  * Complexity, mix of letters, numbers etc.
  * Aging, maximum age and minimum age should be set
  * History, prevent from reusing old pw, usually 5 recommended
  * Limited attempts, 3 and 30 min counter reset
  * Lockout duration, 30 min usually
  * Limited time periods, time of day user can login
  * System messages
    * Logon banner, replace them with legal warning that require user to click OK to acknowledge
    * Last username, many OS display the last successful logon username, should be disabled
    * Last successful logo, after logon system tells when was the last time you logged on, could tell if account compromised


### Personal Identification Numbers (PINs)
* by itstelf relatively weak
* only 10.000 possible combinations for 4-digit numeric PIN
* used as combination with other safeguard (smart card, password)


### Biometrics and behavior
* only absolute method of positively id an individual
* biometrics: fingerprint, facial features, retina and iris patterns (iris > retina)
* behavior: voice, signature, keystroke patterns
* physical access control
  * user presents biometric and the system attempts to id the user by matching input to its DB, also known as one-to-many search
* logical access control 
  * user enters PIN and presents biometric for verification, one-to-one search

    #### Accuracy
    * most important characteristic of biometric systems
    * only fingers/hands and eyes provide unique measurement
    * another important element of accuracy is the system’s ability to detect and reject forged or counterfeit input data
    * FRR - False Reject Rate - Type I error
      * Authorized users who are incorrectly denied access
      * Reducing a system’s sensitivity reduces the FRR but increases the False Accept Rate (FAR)
    * FAR - False Acceptance Rate - Type II error
      * Unauthorized users who are incorrectly granted access
      * Increasing a system’s sensitivity reduces the FAR but increases the FRR
    * CER - Crossover Error Rate
      * point at which the FRR equals the FAR

    #### Speed and throughput
    * describes the length of time required to complete the entire authentication procedure
    * includes stepping up to the system: input PIN, enter biometric, process input data, open/close access door
    * generally accepted are speed of less than five seconds, throughput rate of six to ten per minute, enrollment of less than two minutes

    #### Data storage requirements
    * biometric system input file sizes can be as small as 9 bytes or as large as 10,000 bytes
    * averaging 256 - 1,000 bytes

    #### Realibility
    * The system must operate continuously and accurately without frequent maintenance outages

    #### Acceptability
    * Acceptance by users is the biggest hurdle to widespread implementation of biometric systems
    * Certain privacy and ethics issues arise with the prospect of these systems being used to collect medical or other physiological data about employees
    * intrusiveness of the data collection procedure and required physical contact with common system components (eye against plastic cup)



### One-time passwords
* is valid for one logon session only
* is considered a dynamic password, changes at regular interval/event
* a static password is a password that is the same for each logon
* provides maximum security for access control

### Tokens
* access control devices such as key fobs, dongles, smart cards, magnetic cards, and keypad or calculator-type cards that store static passwords (or digital certificates) or generate dynamic passwords
* Static password tokens
  * store a static pw or digital certificate
* Synchronous dynamic password tokens
  * continuously generate new pw/passcode at fixed interval
  * typically valid for 60 seconds and only for single logon
* Asynchronous
  * challenge-response
  * Generate a new password or passcode asynchronously by calculating the correct response to a system-generated random challenge string that’s manually entered into the token by its owner
* Tokens provide 2FA
* RADIUS, TACACS+ support tokens


### Single sign-on (SSO)
* From the security administrator’s perspective, multiple accounts mean multiple vulnerabilities
* SSO allows a user to present a single set of logon credentials, typically to an authentication server, which then transparently logs the user on to all other enterprise systems and applications for which that user is authorized
* problems are: after authentication you get everywhere, SSO difficult and time consuming to implement
* SSO is commonly implemented by third-party ticket-based solutions

#### Kerberos
* perhaps the most popular ticket-based authentication protocol
* open systems protocol by MIT

#### SESAME
* The Secure European System and Applications in a Multi-vendor Environment (SESAME) project, developed by the European Computer Manufacturer’s Association (ECMA), is a ticket-based system, like Kerberos, with some additional security enhancements
* uses public key cryptography to distribute secret keys, incorporates a trusted authentication server at each host, employs MD5 and CRC-32 one-way hash functions, and uses two separate certificates (or tickets) to provide authentication and define access privileges

#### KryptoKnight
* Developed by IBM, KryptoKnight is another example of a ticket-based SSO authentication system that establishes peer-to-peer relationships between the Key Distribution Center (KDC) and its principals
