# Identification, Authentication and Authorization

Two categories of access controls are:

* System access controls
  * protect the entire system and provide a first line of defense for the data contained on the system
* Data access controls
  * specifically implemented to protect the data contained on the system

# System access controls
* protect systems and information by restricting access to the system
* can provide complete authentication, authorization, and accountability (AAA), it’s authentication for which they are renowned
* Authentication based on any three factors
  1. Something you know (pw, PIN)
  2. Something you have (smart card, token)
  3. Something you are (fingerprint, retina)

## Identification and authentication
* I&A (Identification and Authentication) techniques: pw, PIN, biometric, SSO...
* Identification 
  * simple mechanism based on username, process, computername, MAC, IP..
  * only requirements are that it must uniquely identify the user
  * no labels like CEO or accounting
  * shared accounts should be avoided
  * act of claiming a spceific identity
* Authentication
  * act of verifying the identity

### Passwords and passphrases
* most common authentication mechanism in use today
* problems
  * insecure, user often choose pw that are easy to remember = easy to guess, and write it down
  * transmission and storage, many protocols (FTP, PAP) transmit pw in clear text or stored in plain text files
  * easily broken with brute force
  * inconvenient, long pw can be tiresome to enter
  * refutable, correct pw doesn't guarantee proof of users id, authentication must provide non-repudiation
* Controls, management features, best practices
  * Length, longer the better, should be minimum 6-8
  * Complexity, mix of letters, numbers etc.
  * Aging, maximum age and minimum age should be set
  * History, prevent from reusing old pw, usually 5 recommended
  * Limited attempts, 3 and 30 min counter reset
  * Lockout duration, 30 min usually
  * Limited time periods, time of day user can login
  * System messages
    * Logon banner, replace them with legal warning that require user to click OK to acknowledge
    * Last username, many OS display the last successful logon username, should be disabled
    * Last successful logo, after logon system tells when was the last time you logged on, could tell if account compromised


### Personal Identification Numbers (PINs)
* by itstelf relatively weak
* only 10.000 possible combinations for 4-digit numeric PIN
* used as combination with other safeguard (smart card, password)


### Biometrics and behavior
* only absolute method of positively id an individual
* biometrics: fingerprint, facial features, retina and iris patterns (iris > retina)
* behavior: voice, signature, keystroke patterns
* physical access control
  * user presents biometric and the system attempts to id the user by matching input to its DB, also known as one-to-many search
* logical access control 
  * user enters PIN and presents biometric for verification, one-to-one search

    #### Accuracy
    * most important characteristic of biometric systems
    * only fingers/hands and eyes provide unique measurement
    * another important element of accuracy is the system’s ability to detect and reject forged or counterfeit input data
    * FRR - False Reject Rate - Type I error
      * Authorized users who are incorrectly denied access
      * Reducing a system’s sensitivity reduces the FRR but increases the False Accept Rate (FAR)
    * FAR - False Acceptance Rate - Type II error
      * Unauthorized users who are incorrectly granted access
      * Increasing a system’s sensitivity reduces the FAR but increases the FRR
    * CER - Crossover Error Rate
      * point at which the FRR equals the FAR

    #### Speed and throughput
    * describes the length of time required to complete the entire authentication procedure
    * includes stepping up to the system: input PIN, enter biometric, process input data, open/close access door
    * generally accepted are speed of less than five seconds, throughput rate of six to ten per minute, enrollment of less than two minutes

    #### Data storage requirements
    * biometric system input file sizes can be as small as 9 bytes or as large as 10,000 bytes
    * averaging 256 - 1,000 bytes

    #### Realibility
    * The system must operate continuously and accurately without frequent maintenance outages

    #### Acceptability
    * Acceptance by users is the biggest hurdle to widespread implementation of biometric systems
    * Certain privacy and ethics issues arise with the prospect of these systems being used to collect medical or other physiological data about employees
    * intrusiveness of the data collection procedure and required physical contact with common system components (eye against plastic cup)



### One-time passwords
* is valid for one logon session only
* is considered a dynamic password, changes at regular interval/event
* a static password is a password that is the same for each logon
* provides maximum security for access control

### Tokens
* access control devices such as key fobs, dongles, smart cards, magnetic cards, and keypad or calculator-type cards that store static passwords (or digital certificates) or generate dynamic passwords
* Static password tokens
  * store a static pw or digital certificate
* Synchronous dynamic password tokens
  * continuously generate new pw/passcode at fixed interval
  * typically valid for 60 seconds and only for single logon
* Asynchronous
  * challenge-response
  * Generate a new password or passcode asynchronously by calculating the correct response to a system-generated random challenge string that’s manually entered into the token by its owner
* Tokens provide 2FA
* RADIUS, TACACS+ support tokens


### Single sign-on (SSO)
* From the security administrator’s perspective, multiple accounts mean multiple vulnerabilities
* SSO allows a user to present a single set of logon credentials, typically to an authentication server, which then transparently logs the user on to all other enterprise systems and applications for which that user is authorized
* problems are: after authentication you get everywhere, SSO difficult and time consuming to implement
* SSO is commonly implemented by third-party ticket-based solutions

#### Kerberos
* perhaps the most popular ticket-based authentication protocol
* open systems protocol by MIT

#### SESAME
* The Secure European System and Applications in a Multi-vendor Environment (SESAME) project, developed by the European Computer Manufacturer’s Association (ECMA), is a ticket-based system, like Kerberos, with some additional security enhancements
* uses public key cryptography to distribute secret keys, incorporates a trusted authentication server at each host, employs MD5 and CRC-32 one-way hash functions, and uses two separate certificates (or tickets) to provide authentication and define access privileges

#### KryptoKnight
* Developed by IBM, KryptoKnight is another example of a ticket-based SSO authentication system that establishes peer-to-peer relationships between the Key Distribution Center (KDC) and its principals


## Methodologies and implementation

### Centralized access controls
* maintain user account information in a central location
* LDAP: Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) 
  * IP protocol and a data model, used to support authentication and directory functions for both persons and resources
  * AD, eTrust Directory from CA, Apache Directory Server, Sun Directory Server, IBM SecureWay and Tivoli Directory Server
  * other versions: OpenLDAP, tinyldap
* RAS - Remote Access Service
  * utilizies PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol)
    * PAP (Password Authentication Protocol), CHAP (Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol), EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol)
* RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service)
  * open source, UDP, client-server, provides authentication and accountability, PAP or CHAP
  * password encrypted, username not
  * dynamic passwords
* Diameter
  * nextgen RADIUS
  * backward compatible with RADIUS
* TACACS, TACACS+ (The Terminal Access Controller Access Control System)
  * provides AAA, TCP 49
  * uses static passwords

### Decentralized access controls
* maintain user account information in separate locations by different administrators throughout an organization or enterprise
* Multiple domains and trusts
  * domain is a collection of users, computers, and resources (such as printers) with a common security policy and single administration
  * single domain may be defined; this is considered a centralized access control
  * larger enterprises have multiple domains
  * One-way trust relationships or trust models facilitate communications between multiple domains
* Databases
  * Access to databases is controlled through a database management system (DBMS)
  * DBMS restricts access by different subjects (users) to various objects (such as data and operations) in a database
  * A view is a logical operation that can be used to restrict access to specific information in a database, hide attributes, and restrict queries available to a user


## Methods of attack

### Brute force or dictionary attack
* attacker attempts every possible combination of letters, numbers, and characters to crack a password, passphrase, or PIN
* dictionary attack is essentially a more focused type of brute force attack in which a predefined word list is used

### Buffer or stack overflow
* Buffer overflows constitute the most common and successful type of computer attacks today
* often used in denial-of-service attacks, in certain systems or applications may enable an attacker to gain unauthorized access to a system or directory
* teardrop attack is a type of stack overflow attack that exploits vulnerabilities in the IP protocol

### Man-in-the-middle attacks
* intercepting messages between two parties and forwarding a modified version of the original message
* attacker may substitute his own public key during a public key exchange between two parties

### Others
* Packet (or password) sniffing
  * attacker uses a sniffer to capture network packets and analyze their contents, such as usernames/passwords and shared keys
* Session hijacking
  * similar to a man-in-the-middle attack except that the attacker impersonates the intended recipient instead of modifying messages in transit
* Social Engineering
  * low-tech method is one of the most effective and easily perpetrated forms of attack
  * dumpster diving, shoulder surfing, raiding cubicles (passwords on monitors and under mouse pads), and plain ol’ asking
  * can simply be the attacker calling a user, pretending to be a system administrator and asking for the user’s password, or calling a help desk pretending to be a user and asking to have the password changed
  
  
# Data access controls
* protect systems and information by restricting access to system files and user data based on object (user) identity
* also provide authorization and accountability, relying on system access controls to provide identification and authentication

## Access control techniques
Data access control techniques are generally categorized as either discretionary or mandatory

### DAC - Discretionary access control
* access policy determined by the owner of a file (or other resource)
 * The owner decides who is allowed access to the file and what privileges they have
* File and data ownership
  * every object in a system must have an owner
  * theoretically, an object without an owner is unprotected
* Access rights and permissions
  * the controls that an owner can assign to individual users or groups for specific resource
  * systems define different sets of permissions that are essentially variations or extensions of three basic types of access
    * Read (R): subject can read contents of a file or list contents of a directory
    * Write (W): subject can change the contents of a file or directory (including add, rename, create, and delete)
    * Execute (X): subject can run the program
* ACLs provide flexible method for applying DAC
  * ACL lists the specific rights and permissions that are assigned to a subject for a given object
* Role-based access control assigns group membership based on organizational or functional roles
  * Individuals may belong to one or many groups (acquiring cumulative permissions or limited to the most restrictive set of permissions for all assigned groups), and a group may contain only a single individual (corresponding to a specific organizational role assigned to one person)
  * Access rights and permissions for objects are assigned to groups rather than (or in addition to) individuals
  * greatly simplifies management of rights and permissions

  #### DAC Disadvantages
  * Lack of centralized administration
  * Dependence on security-conscious resource owners
  * Many popular operating systems defaulting to full access for everyone if the owner doesn’t explicitly set permissions
  * Difficult, if not impossible, auditing

### MAC - Mandatory access control
* an access policy determined by the system rather than the owner
* used in multilevel systems that process highly sensitive data, such as classified government and military information
* A multilevel system is a single computer system that handles multiple classification levels between subjects and objects
* Sensitivity labels
  * In a MAC-based system, all subjects and objects must have labels assigned
  * subject's sensitivity label specifies its level of trust
  * object’s sensitivity label specifies the level of trust required for access
  * to access a given object, the subject must have a sensitivity level equal to or higher than the requested object
* Data import and export
  * Controlling the import of information from other systems and export to other systems (including printers) is a critical function of MAC-based systems
  * must ensure that sensitivity labels are properly maintained and implemented so that sensitive information is appropriately protected at all times
* system determines the access policy
* Rule-based access control is one method for applying MAC
* Lattice-based access controls are another method for implementing MAC
  * lattice model is a mathematical structure that defines greatest lower-bound and least upper-bound values for a pair of elements, such as a subject and an object

  #### MAC Disadvantages
  * Lack of flexibility
  * Difficulty in implementing and programming
  * User frustration
