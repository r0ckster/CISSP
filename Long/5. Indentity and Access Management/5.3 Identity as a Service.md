# Changes in IT and Identity as A Service

* Commercial information is everywhere 
  * servers on-site, hosted on servers but also on applications of cloud and mobile phones
* Applications of Cloud and smartphones are installed within the company 
  * applications on the cloud developed by employees without the approval of the company, purchased and implemented by the heads of Marketing and Sales departments, reduce visibility and control of user access to sensitive business data
* Users are blocked by many usernames and passwords 
  * Each user has access to dozens of applications requiring specific identification for each application, which is simply impossible to memorize
* Eliminate self storage identities and provide SSO 
  * new business application, service or management tool will require a new user access rights management directory
  * each of these directories is just another storage directory outside the scope of IT management, is also a target for hackers, and forced users to create and so, to remember another password

Traditional methods of software implementation and access from a local installation at standalone servers are slowly and steadily migrating to centralized cloud-based service models. Furthermore, application hosting and access from cloud-based models are available as subscription services. When software is delivered as a service through the Internet cloud, then it is generically termed as Software as a Service (SaaS).


## IDaaS (Identity as a Service)
* create a centralized source identification, as with Active Directory, authentication to connect to a single, reliable source and to federate identity
* With the establishment of a single authentication source and the federated authorizations, IT can provide a unique user name and password to employees so they can use it on all their devices and supports
* Features of Identity as a Service are
  * Also called "Cloud identity"
  * Integrates easily with cloud hosted applications and third party services
  * easy 2FA
  * Compounds challenges with internal identity management and account/access revocation
  * Larger attack services
  * enables IT to create a security policy for application from user roles
  * Securing devices used to access the companyâ€™s business data
