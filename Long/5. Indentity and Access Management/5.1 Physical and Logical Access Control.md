# Physical and Logical Access Control

* necessary to protect CIA
* heart of infosec and all security
* computer sec req strong perimeter and elaborate defenses

# Concepts of Access Control
* ability to permit or deny the use of an object (system or file) by a subject (individual or process)
* normally defined through a set of rules or permissions: read, write, execute, list, change, and delete

# Control types
* Access control is achieved through an entire set of controls that, identified by purpose, include preventive (which reduce risk) and detective (which identify violations and incidents) controls
* Other types of controls include corrective (which remedy violations and incidents and improve existing preventive and detective controls), deterrent (which discourage violations), recovery (which restore systems and information), and compensating (alternative controls)
* Access controls can be administrative, physical or technical

## Administrative controls
* policies/procedures for orgs overall infosec strategy
* ensures physical/technical controls properly implemented in accordance with secpolicy
* often both preventive and detective
  * Policies and procedures
  * Sec awareness training
  * Asset classification/control
  * Employment policies/practices
  * Account administration
  * Account and log monitoring
  * Review of audit trails

## Technical controls
* technical (or logical) controls use hw and sw technology to implement access control
* preventive
  * encryption: DES, AES
  * Access control mechanisms: biometrics, smart cards, tokens
  * Remote access authentication protocols: PAP, CHAP, RADIUS, LDAP
* detective
  * violation reports
  * audit trails
  * network monitoring and intrusion detection 


## Physical controls
* ensure safety and security of the physical environment
* preventive
  * environmental control: HVAC
  * security perimeters: fences, locks, restricted areas
  * guards and dogs
* detective
  * motion detectors, video cameras
  * environmental sensors and alarms to detect heat, smoke, fire..

When a control failure results in no accesses permitted, this is called fail closed. When a control failure results in all accesses permitted, this is called fail open.
