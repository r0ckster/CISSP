# Physical and Logical Access Control

* necessary to protect CIA
* heart of infosec and all security
* computer sec req strong perimeter and elaborate defenses

# Concepts of Access Control
* ability to permit or deny the use of an object (system or file) by a subject (individual or process)
* normally defined through a set of rules or permissions: read, write, execute, list, change, and delete

# Control types
* Access control is achieved through an entire set of controls that, identified by purpose, include preventive (which reduce risk) and detective (which identify violations and incidents) controls
* Other types of controls include corrective (which remedy violations and incidents and improve existing preventive and detective controls), deterrent (which discourage violations), recovery (which restore systems and information), and compensating (alternative controls)
* Access controls can be administrative, physical or technical

## Administrative controls
* policies/procedures for orgs overall infosec strategy
* ensures physical/technical controls properly implemented in accordance with secpolicy
* often both preventive and detective
  * Policies and procedures
  * Sec awareness training
  * Asset classification/control
  * Employment policies/practices
  * Account administration
  * Account and log monitoring
  * Review of audit trails

## Technical controls
* technical (or logical) controls use hw and sw technology to implement access control
* preventive
  * encryption: DES, AES
  * Access control mechanisms: biometrics, smart cards, tokens
  * Remote access authentication protocols: PAP, CHAP, RADIUS, LDAP
* detective
  * violation reports
  * audit trails
  * network monitoring and intrusion detection 


## Physical controls
* ensure safety and security of the physical environment
* preventive
  * environmental control: HVAC
  * security perimeters: fences, locks, restricted areas
  * guards and dogs
* detective
  * motion detectors, video cameras
  * environmental sensors and alarms to detect heat, smoke, fire..

When a control failure results in no accesses permitted, this is called fail closed. When a control failure results in all accesses permitted, this is called fail open.

### Directive access control 
* A directive access control is deployed to direct, confine, or control the actions of subject to force or encourage compliance with security policies
* Examples of Directive access controls include security guards, guard dogs, security policy, posted notifications, escape route exit signs, monitoring, supervising, work task procedures, and awareness training

### Preventative access control 
* deployed to stop unwanted/unauthorized activity from occurring
* fences, mantraps, auditing, encryption, av...

### Deterrent access control
* deployed to discourage security policy violation
* locks, separation of duties, awareness training

### Detective access control
* deployed to discover unwanted or unauthorized activity
* audit trails, honey ports, IDS...

### Corrective access control
* deployed to restore systems to normal after an unwanted or unauthorized activity has occurred
* Usually corrective controls have only a minimal capability to respond to access violations
* business continuity planning, AV, security policies...

### Recovery access control
* deployed to repair or restore resources, functions, and capabilities after a violation of security policies
* can repair damage as well as stop further damage
* backups and restores, fault tolerant drive systems, server clustering, antivirus software, and database shadowing

### Compensation access control
* deployed to provide various options to other existing controls to aid in the enforcement and support of a security policy
* can also be considered to be controls used in place of or instead of more desirable or damaging controls
  * if a guard dog cannot be used because of the proximity of a residential area, a motion detector with a spotlight and a barking sound playback device can be used


# Access control services
Access control systems provide three essential services:
1. Authentication
2. Authorization
3. Accountability

## Authentication
* (who can log in) is actually a two-step process consisting of identification and authentication (I&A)
* Identification is the means by which a user claims a specific identity to a system
* Authentication is the process of verifying that identity
* username & password = identification & authentication
* authentication determines who can log in

## Auhtorization
* (also referred to as establishment) defines the rights and permissions granted to a user account or process (what you can do)
* after a user is authenticated, authorization determines what that user can do with a system or resource
* Authorization (or establishment) determines what a subject (either a person or a system) can do

## Accountability
* ability to associate users and processes with their actions (what they did)
* Audit trails and system logs are components of accountability
* important security concept thatâ€™s closely related to accountability is non-repudiation
  * Non-repudiation means that a user cannot deny an action
