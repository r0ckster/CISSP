# Incident Response
1. Preparation
2. Detection (identification)
3. Response (Containment)
4. Mitigation (Eradication)
5. Reporting
6. Recovery
7. Remediation
8. Lessons Learned (post-incident activity, post mortem, reporting)

## Preparation
* trainging
* writing IR policies and procedures
* Providing tools
  * sniffing sw, crossover cables, original OS media, removable drivers etc.
* Incident handling checklist

## Detection
* analyze events, determine if a security incident has taken place
* required log files
* many odd events are not sec incidents

## Resposnse
* also called Containment
* prevent further damage
  * take systems off the network
  * isolate traffic
  * power off systems
* make binary images of systems involved
* req management approval: may impact business

## Mitigation
* also called Eradication
* determine cause of incident = so systems can be cleaned
* root cause analysis is required

## Reporting
* must beging upon detection of malicious activity
* technical AND non-technical
* non-technical often neglected but very important for stakeholders (business and mission owners)

## Recovery
* restoring the affected systems to operation
* monitor system to see if infection or attacker returns

## Remediation
* removal of vuln that allowed the incident
  * change pw, use 2FA

## Lessons Learned
* likely to be neglected
* greates potential to improve sec posture
* final report to management
* detail ways the incident could have been quicker/more effective, and areas to improve

## Root-Cause Analysis
* determine underlaying weakness or vuln that allowed the incident
* without this the incident can repeat
