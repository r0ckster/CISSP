# Implementing the Business Continuity Plan
* BCP needs to be written, reviewed, edited, announced and socialized, approved by senior management, kept up-to-date, tested

## Securing senior management approval
* after plan has been documented and reviewed by all stakeholders
  * senior management must examine and approve it, also publicly

## Promoting organizational awareness
* everyone in org must be aware of the plan and his own role
* may mean training

## Maintaining the plan
* BCP person must attend Change Control Board meetings and see if BCP document need some changes
* BCP must be reviewed regulary to see if it would still "work"

## Testing the Disaster Recovery Plan
* Checklist
  * review or read-through the DRP documentation
  * insufficient way to test a DRP
  * logical starting place
* Structured walkthrough
  * team of experts in the org perform step-by-step review of DRP
* Simulation
  * simulation, designated personnel practice the motions
  * team doesn't actually perform recovery processing
* Parallel
  * involves performing all the steps of real recovery, but real live production is kept running
  * done with disaster recovery equipment
  * time-consuming, but can compare test recovery systems with production data
* Interruption
  * same like Parallel but production systems are shut off
  * ultimate DRP test
