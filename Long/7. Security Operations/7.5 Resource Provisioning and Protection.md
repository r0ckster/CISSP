# Resource Provisioning and Protection

# Identification of resource protection needs

* Information is org asset
  * info classification
    * identity info assets
    * identity IT assets that store, process and transmit data
    * define protection level
  * define security objectives
    * C.I.A.
* Protection of info assets is a system that consist of
  * people, process, technology

## Media library
* media = disks, tapes, printouts, CDs
* protect C.I.A.
* HW may be centrally controlled
* Physical protection
  * safes or offsite storage facilities
  * environmental controls


# Protection of information

Level of protection is based on sensitivity of info assets.


## Classification of information catalogs the sensitivity of information assets

First step in data protection, is to classify it

* commercial
  * Public
  * Private
  * Confidential / Proprietary
* Military / Gov.
  * Unclassified
  * CUI - Controlled Unclassified Information
  * Confidential
  * Secret 
  * Top Secret


## Relationships between policy, instruction and guideline 

Operations must understand the relationships between policy, instruction and guideline

* Guideline
  * provides additional & recommended guidance
* Procedure
  * establishes proper steps to take
  * "How Do I Do it?"
* Standard
  * assigns quantifiable measures
  * "What is required?"
* Policy
  * identifies issues and scopre
  * "Why do I need to do this?"

# Protection of Media
* almost all data storage media are "mobile"
* marking and labeling media
  * date created, retention period, classification lvl, who created, date to be destroyed, name and version
* handling of media
  * transport, access, integrity


## Data and media controls
* backup
* electronic vaulting
  * backup data sent electronically to recovery/backup storage location
* remote journaling
  * logging procedure used for a db management system to create on-site journal
  * used to create second journal at the off-site storage location
* database shadowing
  * system creates updates to the production system, journals them and sends to alternate computer



# Protection of IT assets

* asset inventory management (know what you have)
  * hw, sw, vm config items
* configuration management (know how they are config)
  * 80-90% of known vulns bcs of misconfig or missing patches
* incident management


# Protected Resources
* pw files, application program libraries, source code, vendor sw, proprietary packages
* OS= libraries, utilities, directoried, address tables
* communications HW/SW
* main storage, disk & tape storage
* processins equipment
* stand-alone computers and printers
* Sensitive/critical data = files /programs
* System utilities, system logs, audit trails, violation reports
* backup files, sensitive forms, printouts
* people

# The Control

* personnel reviews / background checks
* pw management = personal, system, maintenance
  * 'Trap door', system or app pw included for ease of vendor maintenance
* logging all activities, protected/duplicates log
* problem reporting and change procedures
  * reports. tracks, resolves problems
  * reduces failures and impact, prevent recurrence
* Types - performance/availability
  * hw/sw, environment, procedures/operations, network, safety/security
* Least privilege
  * granual access control over system commands
  * individual access permissions
  * hw/sw elements and procedures to enable authorized and prevent unauthorized access
  * periodic review of access needed/granted
* Separation of duties
  * all changes req approval
  * operational staff should not code or approve changes
* operational staff should not perform security duties
  * security, network, application admninistration

## Separation of Duties - Operator
* installing system sw
* startup & shutdown
* backup/recovery
* moutning disks/tapes
* handling hw
* adding / removing users



## Separation of Duties - Security
* user activities = setting clearances, passwords, other security characteristics, changing profiles
* setting file sensitivity labels
* Settin security characteristics of devices, communications channels
* reviewing audit data



# The problems
* Physical access to the computer room and devices
  * programmers, cleaning/maintenance, vendor support, contract/temp staff, memory content modification, device shutdown
* shoulde surfing
* physical access to printouts
* access to printers and print queues
