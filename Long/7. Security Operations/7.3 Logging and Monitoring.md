# Logging and Monitoring (and auditing)
* help orgs prevent incidents and provide effective response when they occur
* track, record and review activity = provide overall accountability

## Logging Techniques
* logging is the process of recoring info about event to a log file or database
* captures events, changes, messages and other data
* when info needed about an incident, logs are the place to start
* What, When, Where, Who, How 

## Common Log Types
* Security Logs
  * record access to resources as files, folders, printers
* System Logs
  * when a system/service starts or stops
  * can help detect potentially malicious activity
* Application Logs
  * f.e. when user accesses specific object like tables or views
* Firewall and proxy Logs
* Change Logs
  * part of change management process
  * after disaster admins can use these to return system to its last known state

## Protectin Log Data
* if attacker can modify logs, they can erase their activity
  * impossible to re-create events
* important to protect log files against unauthorized access and modification

## Auditing and Monitoring
* tied to accountability
* if you don't have accountability for specific users, you cannot perform an effective audit = org cant enforce sec policies
* true security relies on the ability to verify that individual users perform specific actions
* user activity, traffic patterns, scanning for intrusions, monitoring movement of individuals throughout the orgs premises
* audit controls are detective controls, accountability is the ability to track actions to a specifc user

## Auditing
* Auditing produces audit trails
* trails can be used to re-create events and verify whether security policies were violated
* disadvantage is that audit trails are usually examined after an event
* can be logical and physical

## Auditing Tools
* Windows Event Viewer, Auditpol, Elsave
* Snort, TCPdump
* AUP = warning banner

## Clipping Levels
* allow users to make an occasional mistake
* establishes a baseline violation count to ignore normal user errors
* f.e. 3 wrong attempts to domain account = account locked = admin needed to unlock
