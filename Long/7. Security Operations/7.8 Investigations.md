# Investigations

Computer forensics is the science of conducting a computer crime investigation to determine what has happened and who is responsible, and to collect legally admissible evidence for use in a computer crime case.

* Investigation = what happened, who is responsible, collect evidence'
* Incident handling = what happened, contain and assess damage, restore normal operations
* ^ are often coducted simultaneously
* CIRT - Computer Incident Response Team
* CERT - Computer Emergency Response Team

# Evidence
* information presented in a court of law
* properly gathering evidence one of the most difficult tasks


## Types of evidence
* Direct evidence
  * oral testimony or written statement
* real/physical evidence
  * tangible objects from the crime
  * tools or weapons used, any stolen or damaged property
  * visual or audio surveillance tapes
* documentary evidence
  * originals and copies of business records, computer-generated/stored records
  * manuals, policies, standard, procedures, log files
  * most presented evidence in computer crime case
* Demonstrative evidence
  * used to aid the courts understanding of a case
  * opinions, models, simulations, charts and illustrations
* Other types of evidence
  * best evidence = original, unaltered evidence
  * secondary evidence = duplicate or copy of evidence (backup, photo)
  * corroborative evicende = supports or subsantiates other evidence
  * conclusive evidence = smoking gun, icontrovertible and irrefutable
  * circumstantial evidence = relevant facts, cant be directly or conclusively connected to events

## Rules of evidence

### Best evidence rule
*  “to prove the content of a writing, recording, or photograph, the original writing, recording, or photograph is [ordinarily] required.”
*  exception rule “if data are stored in a computer or similar device, any printout or other output readable by sight, shown to reflect the data accurately, is an ‘original’.”
*  means copy of original HDD = is 'original'

### Hearsay rule
* Hearsay evidence is that evidence that is not based on personal, first-hand knowledge of the witness but rather was obtained through other sources. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, hearsay evidence is normally not admissible in court. This rule exists to prevent unreliable statements by witnesses from improperly influencing the outcome of a trial.
* computer records may be presented as best evidence, if they are computer-generated records untouched by human

## Admissibility of evidence
* computer evidence can be easily manipulated, altered or tampered, commonly misunderstood
  * usually considered suspect in a court of law
* to be admissible, evidence must be
  * Relevant = prove or disprove facts
  * Reliable = proven to be original (evidence handling and chain of custody important)
  * Legally permissible = obtained through legal means
* NOT legally permissible evidence:
  * illegal search and seizure
  * illegal wiretaps or phone taps
  * entrapment or enticement = encourage someone to commit crime that he may have had no intention of committing / or honeypot
  * coercion (forced confession for example)
  * unauthorized / improper monitoring = user must be notified that they may be subject to monitoring

# Chain of custody and evidence life cycle
The chain of custody (or evidence) provides accountability and protection for evidence throughout its entire life cycle and includes the following information, which is normally kept in an evidence log:
* WHO: persons involved = who discovered, collected, seized, analyzed, stored, preserved, transported etc.
* WHAT: description = all evidence is completely and uniquely described
* WHERE: location = specific info about evidences location when its discovered, analyzed, stored, transported
* WHEN: date/time when evidence discovered, collected, seized, analyzed, stored, transported
* HOW: methods used = how evidence is discovered, collected, seized, analyzed, stored, transported
* any time evidence changes possessions or transfered to different media type = properly recorded in the log

## Evidence life cycle
1. Collection and identification
2. Analysis
3. Storage, preservation, and transportation
4. Presentation in court
5. Return to victim (owner)

### 1. Collection and identification
In general, law enforcement officials can search and/or seize computers and other electronic evidence under any of four circumstances:
* voluntary or consensual = owner can freely surrender the evidence (computer)
* subpoena = court issues order individual to deliver the evidence
* search warrant (writ of possession) = by court, allowing official to search and seize specific evidence (writ of posession is for civil cases)
* exigent circumstances = if probable cause exists / destruction of evidence imminent, that evidence may be searched or seized without warrant 

When evidence collected
* log = description, persons who discovered, time/date, location
* mark the evidence without damaging evidence or use evidence tag
* seal evidence
* protect evidence

### 2. Analysis
* examining the evidence
* conducted with extreme caution by properly trained and experienced personnel only
* ensure evidence is not altered, damaged or destroyed

### 3. Storage, preservation and transportation
* evidence must be properly stored in a secure facility and preserved to prevent damage or contamination from various hazards, including intense heat or cold, extreme humidity, water, magnetic fields, and vibration
* if not properly protected may be inadmissible in court, and the party responsible for collection and storage may be liable
* care must also be exercised during transportation to ensure that evidence is not lost, damaged, or destroyed


### 4. Presentation in court
* presented in court must continue to follow the chain of custody and be handled with the same care as at all other times in the evidence life cycle
* process continues throughout the trial until all testimony related to the evidence is completed and the trial is over

### 5. Return to victim (owner)
* normally returned to owner when trial over
* sometimes some evidence may be ordered to be destroyed
* Any evidence obtained through a search warrant is legally under the control of the court, possibly requiring the original owner to petition the court for its return.
