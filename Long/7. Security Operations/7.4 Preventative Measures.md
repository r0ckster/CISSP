# Preventative Measures

## IDS and IPS
* Inline and out-of-band
* network or host-based
* pattern matching = compares to known static signatures
* protocol behaviour = detects protocol errors lie SYN/FIN TCP packets
* anomaly detection = report if traffic varies from normal baseline

## SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)
* correlate data from many sources
* continuous monitoring

## Endpoint Security
* Security suits, AV, app whitelisting, removable media control
* disk encryption, HIPS, firewalls

## AV
* mostly dependent on signature detection
* blacklisting
* app whitelisting (file path/name, hash, code signature)

## Honeypots
* system designed to attract attackers
* may have legal risks
* honey net = real or simulated network of honeypots
