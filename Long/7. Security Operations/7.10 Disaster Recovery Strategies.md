# Emergency response
* emergency response teams must be identified
* need written procedures to keep critical bunisess functions operating

# Damage assessment
* experts to determine the extent of the damage
* may be performed in stages = first quick walkthrough followed by detailed assessment
* purpose is to determine if buildings/equipments can be still used, or if need repair or replaced


# Personnel safety
* highest priority - ahead of buildings, equipment etc.
* people make the business run - and also human life...

## Personnel notification
* notify all affected personnel
* need multiple methods of communication
* regular status report and updates

# Backups and off-site storage
* must be performed regulary and also off-site
* determine what kind of: full, differential, incremental and how frequently
  * time taken
  * effort required
  * procedures for restoring from backups compared with other methods of re-creating the data
* off-site should be close enough so the media retrieval doesn't take too long, but not too close main site
* purpose of off-site media storage is to make up-to-date data available in the event that the primary data center is damaged

# Software escrow agreements
* software vendor sends a copy of its software code to a third-party escrow organization for safekeeping

# External communications
* Open communication during a disaster is vital so that customers, suppliers, and investors don’t panic because they don’t know the true extent of the disaster


# Utilities
* Uninterruptible power supplies (UPSes) and emergency electric generators are used to provide electric power during prolonged power outages
* long power outage (more than a day or two), it is also essential to have a plan for the replenishment of generator fuel

# Logistics and supplies
* if a business operation relies upon a just-in-time shipment of materials for its operation, perhaps an emergency ration of those materials needs to be stockpiled 

# Fire and water protection
* disasters disrupt public utilities, including water supplies or delivery
* In many places, businesses could be ordered to close if they can’t prove that they can effectively fight a fire using other means, such as FM-200

# Documentation
* Continuity and recovery documentation must exist in hard copy in the event that it’s unavailable via technical means such as laptop computers

# Data processing continuity planning
* Cold site
  * basically empty computer room with environmental facilities (UPS, HVAC, etc.) but no equipment
  * requires more time to set up running
* Warm site
  * basically like cold site but computers and communications links already in place
* Hot site
  * basically copy of main site, everything in place and running, data synced
  * most expensive
* Reciprocal site
  * two orgs sign agreement that pledges to one another the availability of the other’s data center in the event of a disaster
  * was used when data centers were rare
* Multiple data centers
  * daily operations ran out of two or more data centers
  * no need for cold, warm, hot sites
