Integrating Security Risk Considerations into Acquisition Strategy and Practice
-helps to minimize introduction of new/unknown risks
-security in org is only as strong as its weakest link
	-often one of orgs is less secure - in mergers
-rarely straightforward to reconsile policies, requirements, business processes and procedures during a merger
-DON'T assume one orgs (even if its the buyers) policies etc. are better than others
-everything should be assessed to id best solutions


Hardware, software, and services
-any new should be evaluated to determine impact on overall security and risk posture
-integration issues can have a negative impact


Third-party assessment and monitoring
-important to consider the third parties that each org brings to the table
-ensure that the risk level related to them has not changed in light of merger/acquisition
-contracts (privacy, nda, sec req, SLA's) should be reviewed


Minimum security requirements
-baselines should be documented so they are understood and considered in strategy/practice
-blending security requirements from two parties is not simple
-overlaps, underlaps and contradictions must be reconsiled
-transition period may be required > time to adjust sec configs and architectures


Service-level requirements (SLA's)
-establish minimum performance standards for a system, application, network, or service
-examples
	-Service Desk: prioritize incidents as 1,2,3,4. Response times 1h, 2h, 24h
	-ISP: maximum acceptable downtime, if exceeded = penalty
