Business Continuity
-keeps company in 'business' after disaster
-takes more into account than just technology
-regulatory req for executive management obligations for fiscal responsibility


Disasters
1.Natural disasters
	-fires, explosions, earthquakes, storms, floods, pandemics...
2.Human disasters
	-intentional or unintentional, accident, crime, war, terrorism, cyber attack...
3.Environmental disasters
	-blackout, surge, spike, app/sw flaw, component failure

-personnels safety must be guaranteed even at the expense of restoration of operations


Recovery team
-location of residence
-skills and experience
-ability and willingness to respond
-health and family (determines probability to serve)
-identify backups
	-other team members, external resources


Emergency response
-Personnel safety: includes first-aid, searchinh for pesonnel...
-Evacuation: evacuation procedures to prevent any hazard to employees
-Asset protection: includes buildings, vehicles and equipment
-Damage assessment: this could involve outside structural engineers to assess gamae to buildings and equipment
-Emergency notification: response team communication, and keeping management and organization staff informed


Public utilities and infrastructure
-Often interrupted during a disaster
-Electricity: UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply), generator
-Water: building could be closed if no water is available for fire suppression
-Natural gas: heating
-Wasterwater: if disabled, building could be closed
-Steam heat


Logistics and supplies
-Food and drinking water
-Blankets and sleeping cots
-Sanitation (toilets, showers, etc)
-Tools
-Spare parts

-Access to procedures, business records


Restoration and recovery
-Repairs to facilities, equipment
-Replacement equipment
-Restoration of utilies
-Resumption of business operations in primary business facilities


Improving system resilience and recovery
-Off-site media storage
 	-Assurance of data recovery
-Server clusters
	-Improved availability
  -Geographics clusters: members far apart
-Data replication
	-Application, DMBS, OS or Hardware
	-Maintains current data on multiple servers even in remote places


Business Continuity Plan (BCP)
-goal to ensure business will continue to operate before, throughout and after disaster
-focus in business as a whole
-ensure ciritical service/functions can still be carried
-long-term strategy
-could include running business in other location or with different tools/processes

BCP Initiation and Recovery Steps
-BCP Cycle
	-Identification > Prevention > Declaration > Escalation > Containment > Implementation > Recovery
-Business Recovery Steps
	-Business recovery: Facility and Operations recovery
	-Process recovery: HR and Business Unit recovery
	-IT Recovery: Data and telecommunications recovery


Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)
-provides short-term plan for IT-oriented disruptions
-focuses on efficience, mitigate impact of disaster, recovery of critical IT systems
-DOESN'T focus on long-term business imbact in the same fashion as
-deals with restoring normal business operations after disaster
-DRP is a subset of BCP


Summary
-BCP and DRP are orgs last line of defense, when other controls have failed
-may prevent drastic events such as injury, loss of life, failure of an organization
-BCP/DRP process forces to view orgs critical processes and assests in a clarifying light
-critical assets must be identified and key business processes understood
-standards are deployed
-risk analysis conducted during BCP/DRP plan can lead to immediate mitigating steps
