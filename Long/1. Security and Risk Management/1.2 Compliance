Standards and Frameworks
-different information security standards consist of compulsory requirements for homogenous use of software, technology and security controls

Baseline
-minimum level of security that every system must need

Guideline
-recommendations on how to meet standards and baselines

ISO/IEC 27000
-the overview of information security management systems, and terms and definitions commonly used in the ISMS family of standards

ISO/IEC 27001
-ISMS requirements
-Information Security Management System Standard

Plan - Do - Check - Act (PDCA)
-establish objectives, make plans, implementations
-measure results to see if objectives are met and how to correct/improve plans


Enterprise Architecture Development Frameworks

Zachman framework
-two-dimensional model that uses six basic communication
-What, How, Where, Who, When, Why
-Planned, Owner, Designer, Builder, Implementer, Worker

TOGAF
-origins in the US DOD
-provides approach to design, implement and govern enterprises information architecture
-can be used with Business, Data, Applications and Technology Architecture

DoDAF
-focuses in command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems and processes
-important that they use same protocol types and data elements

MODAF
-right data in right format to the right people - asap
-allows fast and accurate decisions



Security Enterprise Architecture Development
-SABSA model (Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture)
	-Is a framework and methodology for enterprise security architecture and service management
	-It provides a life-cycle model so that the architecture can be constantly monitored and improved upon over time
-SP 800-53
	-NIST Standard that controls that agencies need to put into place to
be compliant with the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002
	-The control categories (families) are the management, operational, and technical controls prescribed for an information system to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its information


Security Controls Development
-CobiT - Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology
-It defines goals for the controls that should be used to properly manage IT and to ensure that IT maps to business needs
-CobiT is broken down into four domains: Plan and Organize, Acquire and Implement, Deliver and Support, and Monitor and Evaluate

Corporate Governance
-COSO
-Treadway Commission in 1985 to deal with fraudulent financial activities and reporting. Control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information, communication and monitoring

Process Management
-ITIL
	-ITIL is the de facto standard of best practices for IT service management
	-It was created because of the increased dependence on information technology to meet business needs
-Six Sigma
	-Six Sigma is a process improvement methodology
	-It is the "new and improved" Total Quality Management (TQM) that hit the business sector in the 1980s
	-Was was developed by Motorola with the goal of identifying and removing defects in its manufacturing processes
-CMMI
	-CMMI aims to develop structured steps that can be followed so an organization can evolve from one level to the next and constantly improve its processes and security posture


Top-down approach
-initiation, support and direction come from top management

Bottom-up approach
-staff members (usually IT) try to develop security program without getting top managements support or direction



Life cycle process
1. Plan and Organize
2. Implement
3. Operate and maintain
4. Monitor and evaluate



NIST 800-30
-Risk Management Guide for Information Technology



OCTAVE (Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation)
-is a security framework for determining risk level and planning defenses against cyber assaults
-the framework defines a methodology to help organizations minimize exposure to likely threats, determine the likely consequences of an attack and deal with attacks that succeed.
