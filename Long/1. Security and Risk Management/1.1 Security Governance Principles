CIA

Confidentiality
	-data has not been disclosed to unauthorized individuals
	-access control and encryption
Integrity
	-data not modified
	-hashing
Availability
	-data is accessible
	-fault tolerance, redundancies, backups


Threat, Risk, and Countermeasure

Threat Agent 
	-An entity that may act on a vulnerability.
Threat
	-Any potential danger to information life cycle.
Vulnerability
	-A weakness or flaw that may provide an opportunity for a threat agent.
Risk
	-The likelihood of a threat agent exploits the discovered vulnerability.
Exposure
	-An instance of being compromised by a threat agent.
Countermeasure/safeguard
	-An administrative, operational, or logical mitigation against potential risk(s)


Concepts of Security Governance

Policy
-Management directives that establish expectations (goals & objectives), and assign roles & responsibilities 

Standards
-Functional specific mandatory activities, actions, and rules

Process & Procedure
-Step-by-step implementation instructions

Guideline
-General statement, framework, or recommendations to augment process or procedure


Roles and responsibilities

Senior Manager
	-ultimate responsibility
Information Security Officer
	-functional responsibility
Data Owner
	-determines data classification
Data Custodian
	-preservers datas CIA
User/Operator
	-performs tasks, comply with requirements and practice due care
Auditor
	-examines security


Security Controls

Preventive Controls 
	-stops attacks
	-physical, administrative and technical measures
Detective
	-record events
	-practices, processes and tools that identify and possibly react
Corrective
	-after attack, prevents another attack
	-involve physical, administrative and technical measures to react to detection
Recovery
	-after attack, restores operation
Compensating
	-substitutes other control that is ainadequate
	-instead of replasing OS > implement application whitelisting
	-instead of security guard > use swipe card system


Defense in depth
-Physical security
-Perimeter
-Intranet
-Host
-Application
-Data


Due Care
-legal duty of a company
-if company fails (knowingly or unknowingly) to perfom steps, can be held liable in court

Due Dilligence
-best practices company SHOULD follow
-if it doesn't follow, it COULD face an attack, but might not be legally liable


Least privilege
-individual, program or system process is not granted any more access privileges than are necessary to perform the task

Need to know
-goes beyond an individual's role and authorization level to look at the situation
-may look at who's involved with a specific mission to set authorizations on a dynamic basis

Separation of duties
-concept of having more than one person required to complete a task
-internal control intended to prevent fraud and error

Defence in depth
-coordinated use of multiple security countermeasures to protect the integrity of the information assets
-based on the military principle
-more difficult for an enemy to defeat a complex and multi-layered defense system than to penetrate a single barrier


Rings
-Ring number determines the access level
-program may access only data that resides on the same ring, or a less privileged ring
-program may call services residing on the same, or a more privileged ring
		Ring 0 contains kernel functions of the OS
  	Ring 1 contains the OS
    Ring 2 contains the OS utilities
    Ring 3 contains the applications
