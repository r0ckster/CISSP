Risk is the relationship between the likelihood of a loss and the potential impact to the business


Risk management
-process of determining the maximum acceptable level of overall risk to and from a proposed activity
-then using risk assessment techniques to determine the initial level of risk
-if excessive > develo a strategy to meliorate appropriate individuals risk > until the overall level of risk is reduced to an acceptable level

THREAT: natural or man-made event that could have negative imapct on the org

VULNERABILITY: flaw/error/oversight, that can be exploited to violate system sec policy

CONTROLS: mechanisms used to restrain/reduce vulnerabilities (corrective/detective/preventive or deterrent)



NIST 800-30 Risk Management Guide
-a Standard Risk Management Guide for Information Technology. It contains 9 steps on risk management listed below:

   1. step in risk analysis process: System Characterization
   2. step in risk analysis process: Threat Identification
   3. step in risk analysis process: Vulnerability Identification
   4. step in risk analysis process: Control analysis
   5. step in risk analysis process: Likelihood Determination
   6. step in risk analysis process: Impact Analysis
   7. step in risk analysis process: Risk Determination
   8. step in risk analysis process: Control Recommendations
   9. step in risk analysis process: Results Documentation



NIST Special Publication 800-37
-provides four steps for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems

Step 1 Initiation Phase - IS and risk mitigation plan is researched
Step 2 Security Certification Phase - security of the system is assessed and documented
Step 3 Security Accreditation Phase - Decision to accept the risk is made and documented by the approving authority
Step 4 Continuous Monitoring Phase - ongoing security of the system is verified



Qualitative Risk Assesment
-for a given scope of assets, identify:
-Vulnerabilities
-Threats
-Threat probability (Low/Medium/High)
-Impact (Low/Medium/High)
-Countermeasures


Quantitative Risk Assesment
-Extension of a qualitative risk assessment
-Metrics for each risk are:
	- Asset value: replacement cost and/or income derived through the use of an asset
	- Exposure Factor (EF): Portition of asset`s value lost through a threat
	- Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) = Asset ($) x EF (%)
	- Annualized Rate of Occurence (ARO): Propability of loss in a year
	- Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE) = SLE ($) x ARO (%)


Handling Risk
-risk can be dealt with in four general ways, either individually or in combination
	-risk reduction — Implement a countermeasure to alter or reduce the risk.
	-risk transference — Purchase insurance to transfer a portion or all of the potential cost of a loss to a third party.
	-risk acceptance - deal with risk by accepting the potential cost and loss if the risk occurs.
	-risk rejection - Pretend that the risk doesn’t exist and ignore it. Although this is not a prudent course of action, it is one that some organizations choose to take.


Best way to handle risk depends on
-cost of the countermeasure
-value of the asset
-amount by which risk-reduction techiniques reduce the total risk
-greates risk reduction + lowest annual cost = usually chosen

Threat X Vulnerability X Asset value = Total risk

Total risk - Countermeasures = Residual risk


-can't be 100% secure, risks always remain
-residual risk is amount that is left after safeguards/controls have been put in place
