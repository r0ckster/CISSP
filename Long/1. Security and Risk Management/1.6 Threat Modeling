	-Assets - what valuable data/equipment should be secured?
	-Threats - what may an attacker do to the system?
	-Vulnerabilities - what flaws in the system


Who does Threat Models and when?
-ideally threat models are created during system design prior to any deployment
-in practice, threat models are often created for existing systems, making it part of maintenance
-system designers with security experience are best equipped to identify the threats.



Steps to Threat Modeling
-Identify the assets
-Describe the architecture
-Break down the applications
-Identify the threats
-Document and classify the threats
-Rate the threats



Identify assets
-Entry and Exit points
-System assets and resources
-Trust levels (access categories)
