# Software Security Control Testing

## Software Testing Methods
* discovering programming errors
* custom apps don't have a vendor providing sec patches
* source code review
* two general approaches
  * Static and dynamic analysis
  * also manual code review
  * pair programming employed in agile programming shops

### Static and Dynamic testing
* static = code not running
  * review source code for insecure practices, unsafe functions..
  * Unix program: lint
  * compiler warnings
* Dynamic testing = while code is executing
* white box test = source code available
* black box test = source code not available


### Traceability Matrix
* Maps customer requirements to software testing plan

### Synthetic Transactions
* simulating business activities
* often used for web apps

## Software Testing Levels
* Unit Testing: components like functions, procedures or objects
* Installation Testing: software as it's installed and first operated
* Integration Testing: multiple sw components as they are combined into a working system
* Regression Testing: testing after updates, modifications or patches
* Acceptance Testing: ensure meets customers requirements

## Fuzzing
* type of black box and Dynamic testing
* send random malformed data to find crashes
* usually finds many flaws

## Combinatorial software testings
* Seeks to identify and test all unique combinations of software inputs
* Pairwise testings (also called all pairs testings)

## Misuse case testing
* Formally model an adversary misuings the application
* way to consider negative security outcomes is threat modeling
* Microsoft highlights it in their Security Development Lifecycle (SDL)

## Test coverage analysis
* Identifies the degree to which code testing applices to the entire application
* To ensure that there are no significat gaps

## Analyze and report test outputs
* Security test results are easy to produce, actually improving security is much more difficult
* Data must be analyzed to determine what action to take


# Distributed Applications
* an application that consists of components on separate, networked systems

## Security in distributed systems
