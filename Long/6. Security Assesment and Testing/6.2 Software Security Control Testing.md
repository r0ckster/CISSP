# Software Security Control Testing

## Software Testing Methods
* discovering programming errors
* custom apps don't have a vendor providing sec patches
* source code review
* two general approaches
  * Static and dynamic analysis
  * also manual code review
  * pair programming employed in agile programming shops

### Static and Dynamic testing
* static = code not running
  * review source code for insecure practices, unsafe functions..
  * Unix program: lint
  * compiler warnings
* Dynamic testing = while code is executing
* white box test = source code available
* black box test = source code not available


### Traceability Matrix
* Maps customer requirements to software testing plan

### Synthetic Transactions
* simulating business activities
* often used for web apps

## Software Testing Levels
* Unit Testing: components like functions, procedures or objects
* Installation Testing: software as it's installed and first operated
* Integration Testing: multiple sw components as they are combined into a working system
* Regression Testing: testing after updates, modifications or patches
* Acceptance Testing: ensure meets customers requirements

## Fuzzing
* type of black box and Dynamic testing
* send random malformed data to find crashes
* usually finds many flaws

## Combinatorial software testings
* Seeks to identify and test all unique combinations of software inputs
* Pairwise testings (also called all pairs testings)

## Misuse case testing
* Formally model an adversary misuings the application
* way to consider negative security outcomes is threat modeling
* Microsoft highlights it in their Security Development Lifecycle (SDL)

## Test coverage analysis
* Identifies the degree to which code testing applices to the entire application
* To ensure that there are no significat gaps

## Analyze and report test outputs
* Security test results are easy to produce, actually improving security is much more difficult
* Data must be analyzed to determine what action to take


# Distributed Applications
* an application that consists of components on separate, networked systems

## Security in distributed systems

Securing distributed systems is anything but easy, and it boils down to three distinct issues:

Software integrity
* challenge, bcs application may consist of software components located on various systems located in different physical locations, and owned/managed by other parties
* keeping track of versions hard

Data integrity
* challenging, bcs data may reside in many locations
* data replication makes it even more difficult, how to make sure it's in sync

Access control
* all distributed components need to communicate
* need to make sure components can identify and verify each others, can't just blindly trust

## Agents
* a software component in a distributed system that performs a particular service
* example of an agent might be a system that takes a credit card number and builds a merchant transaction to send to the bank
* agent processes the transaction and gives a yea or nay response back to the main application
 
 ## Applets
 * a component in a distributed environment that’s downloaded and executed by a Web browser
 * two most popular environments for applets are Java and ActiveX
  * Java runs in sandbox, ActiveX not
  * many times filtered out on FW or proxy level

## Object-Oriented Environments
* Object orientation is known as OO
* based upon a fundamental principle: Objects, after they’re written, can be reused again and again, thereby making the enterprise’s entire software development effort more and more efficient over time
* An object is encapsulated, which means that the inner workings of an object are hidden and can remain so
* Objects communicate with each other by using messages
* When an object receives a message, it performs whatever function it was designed to do, which is its method
* An object that’s running is an instance
* The process of starting an instance is instantiation
*  an instance can also refer to an object that’s a member of a class of objects


# Databases
* a mechanism used to define, store, and manipulate data
* DBMS - Database Management System
* exist apart from application software, a database contains the data as well as a programming and command interface used to create, manage, and administer data
* DBMSs generally contain an access-control mechanism used to protect data and permit only certain users, or classes of users, to view or modify certain portions of the database
* Relational database and object-oriented database are the most common types of databases

## Database security
* granularity of access control is a description of how finely you can control who can see which tables, rows, and fields
  * low granularity is read or read/write access to all rows and fields in a table
  * high granularity restricts access to certain fields and even certain rows
  * high granularity means extra hours manaing permissions
* Views can be employed to simplify security issues, easier to manage
* Aggregation is a matter of serious concern from a security and privacy perspective
  * Aggregation refers to the process of combining low-sensitivity data items together, resulting in high-sensitivity data

## Data dictionaries
* database of databases
* In a large application with many tables (some applications have hundreds of tables), a data dictionary could exist as a database containing all the info of tables etc.
* DBMS, the application, and security tools such as access control use a data dictionary
* A data dictionary can be used to create or re-create tables, manage security access, and as a control point for managing the schema of the application’s database


## Data warehouses
* a special purpose database that’s used for business research, decision support, and planning; comparatively, typical databases support daily business operations
* not wise to do on production-data
* The type of database used for decision support is called a data warehouse
* also called data mining
  * fraud-detection
  * spot valuable trends
