# System Security Control Testing

# Assessing Access Controls

## Penetration testing
* white hat hacker, authorized to break into an org
* pentest may include
  * network (internet, internal or DMZ)
  * War dialing (technique to automatically scan a list of telephone numbers)  
  * Wireless
  * Physical (gain entrance)
* black box = zero knowledge
  * no info to attacker
* white box = full knowledge
  * pentester gets network diagram, policies etc..   
* gray box = partial-knowledge

## Social engineering
* exploit human/mind
* trick user to click a link

## Penetration tester tools and methodology
* pentester must ensure confidentiality of data they access
* metasploit (open source)
* Core Impact and Immunity Canvas (closed source)
* Methodology
  * planning
  * reconnaissance
  * scanning/enumeration
  * vulnerability assesment
  * exploitation
  * reporting

## Vulnerability Testing
* vulnerability scanning with tools like Nessus, OpenVAS
* finds vulns
* requires manual verification and assessment
* must be matched to real threats to find true risk

## Security Audit
* tests against a public standard
* PCI-DDS

## Security Assessment
* view many controls across multiple domains
  * policies and procedures
  * administrative controls
  * change management
  * other tests (pentest, vuln ass, sec audits)

## Internal and third party audits
* internal audits, assessing adherence to policy
* external audits
  * require security pro to play a role
  * response and remediation to audit findings
  * demonstrating mitigations
  
## Log reviews
* easiest way to verify access control mechanisms are working
* Network security sw/hw
  * AV logs, IDS/IPS, VPN, proxy, routers/FWs, authentication servers
* OS
  * System events, Audit records
* Applications
  * client requests and server responses
  * usage information
  * operational actions
   
## Centralized logging
* central repository allows for more scalable security monitoring and intrusion detection
* syslog, udp port 514
* log retention may be relevant to legal or regulatory compliance
