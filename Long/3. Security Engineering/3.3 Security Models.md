## Security Models of Control
- Determine how security will be implemented
- what subjects can access the system and what objects
- formalize sec policy


->Security Policy (NIST, ISO)

---> Security Model (Bell LaPadula)

-----> Programming Code (SQL, Python, C++)

--------> Operating System (Win, Linux)
    
## Bell-LaPadula Security Model (1973)
* focuses on confidentiality and controlled access to classified info
* uses no read-up & no write down
  * A subject at a given security level may not read an object at a higher security level (no read up)
  * A subject at a given security level must not write to any object at a lower security level (no write down)
  
## Biba Security Model (1977)
*  policy that describes a set of access control rules designed to ensure data integrity
  * A subject at a given level of integrity must not read an object at a lower integrity level (no read down)
  * A subject at a given level of integrity must not write to any object at a higher level of integrity (no write up)
  
## Comparing Bell-Lapadula and Biba security models
* need to protect secrets, use Bell-LaPadula
  * no "write down", no "read up"
* need to stay on target, use Biba
  * no "writ up", no "read down"
* both designed for military, to protect high-lvl secrets

## State Machine Model

`
The state machine model is based on a finite state machine. State machines are used to model complex systems and deals with acceptors, recognizers, state variables, and transaction functions. The state machine defines the behavior of a finite number of states, the transitions between those states, and actions that can occur.
`

## Clark-Wilson security model (1987)
* designed to protect data at ALL levels
* based on transactions
  * well-formed transactions move a system from one consistent state to another consistent state
* data integrity model
* Two principals: users and programs (called transformation procedures or TPs)
* Two types of data: unconstrained data times (UDIs) and constrained data items (CDIs)
* Users must be authenticated
* Transaction logs are kept


## Mandatory Access Control (MAC) security model
* access control created by central authority (OS, system admin) and enforced by OS
* more robust than Discretionary Access Control, because hijacked process/account can't monkey around

## Discretionary Access Control (DAC) security model
* The owner of an object contols who and what may access it 
* Access is at the owner's discretion

## Role Based Access Control (RBAC) security model
* newer than MAC and DAC, to deal with complexity issue
* RBAC groups users into roles, and permissions into rights
  * users permission can be achieved by just changing the roles
  
  
## Noninterference security model
* objects and subjects of different levels donâ€™t interfere with the objects and subjects of other levels
* model uses inputs and outputs of either low or high sensitivity
* each data access attempt is independent of all others and data cannot cross security boundaries


## Chinese wall security model
* a business term describing an information barrier within an organization that was erected to prevent exchanges or communication that could lead to conflicts of interest
* may be erected to separate and isolate people who make investments from those who are privy to confidential information that could influence the investment decisions
* firms are generally required by law to safeguard insider information and ensure that improper trading does not occur
