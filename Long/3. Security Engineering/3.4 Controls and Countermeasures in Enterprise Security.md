# Controls and Countermeasures in Enterprise Security

Steps in processes, or components in info systems, that are used to enforce compliance with security (or business) rules. Enforcement can 
be based on technology or manual procedure performed by individual.

## Types of controls
* Preventive controls
  * prevent errors and unauthorized actions
  * FW, IPS, AV, Mantraps etc.
* Detective controls
  * detect errors and unauthorized activities
* Corrective controls
  * reverse or minimize impact of errors and unauthorized events
  * also known as recovery controls
* Automatic controls
  * automatically enforce sec policy
* Manual controls
  * must be proactively performed to enforce sec policy
  
 A control is preventive, detective, or corrective; also, the control is either automatic or manual
 
 ## Operations controls
 
 Processes and procedures that are used to protect business operations and information
 * Resource protection
 * Privileged entity controls
 * Change controls
 * Media controls
 * Administrative controls
 * Trusted recovery

## Resource protection

Resource protection is the broad category of controls that protects information assets and information infrastructure
* Communications hardware and software
  * routers, switches, firewalls, load balancers, multiplexers, fax machines, Virtual Private Network (VPN) servers, and so on, as well as the software that these devices use
* Computers and their storage systems
  * corporate servers, Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) systems, storage area networks (SANs), network attached storage (NAS), and backup devices
* Business data
  * stored information such as financial data, sales and marketing information, personnel and payroll data, customer and supplier data
* System data
  * operating systems, utilities, userid and password files, audit trails, configuration files
* Backup media
  * tapes, removable disks etc.
* Software
  * application source code, programs, tools, software etc.
  
## Privileged entity controls
* mechanism built into computer OS
* give privileged access to HW, software and data
* in unix and windows, controls that permit privileged functions reside in the OS

## Change controls
* people-operated processes, used to govern architectural and configuration changes in production
* formal process of proposal, design, review, approval, implementation and recordkeeping
* Change management
  * approval-based process that ensures that only approved changes are implemented
* Configration management
  * records all the soft configuration (settings and parameters in the operating system, database, and application), and software changes that are performed with approval from the change management process


## Media controls
* broad category of controls that are used to manage information classification and physical media
* marking information according to its sensitivity, as well as the subsequent handling, storage, transmission, and disposal procedures that accompany each classification level

## Administrative controls
* refer to the family of controls that includes least privilege, separation of duties, and rotation of duties
* these controls form the basis of many processes as well as access control and function control methodologies

## Trusted recovery
* concerned with the processes and procedures that support the hardware or software recovery of a system
* the confidentiality and integrity of the information stored on and the functions served by a system being recovered must be preserved at all times
* primary issue with system recovery is that a system may be operated briefly in maintenance or single-user mode in which all the software controls protecting the operating system and business data may not be functioning
* organizations that are concerned with the integrity and confidentiality of data should have well-defined processes and procedures for system recovery to ensure that no inappropriate disclosure or leakage of sensitive information can occur
