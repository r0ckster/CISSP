# Site and Facility Design for Physical Security

## Physical Security Threats
* fire
* water
* vibration and movement
* severe weather
* electricity

### Fire

Fire suppression and extinguishing systems fight fires by removing one of these three elements or by temporarily breaking up the chemical reaction between these three elements: that is, separating the fire triangle. Fires are classified according to the fuel type, as listed in the table below.

* Class A
  * ordinary combustiles: wood, paper, fabric
  * supression agent: water, soda, acid
* Class B
  * flammable liquids: gas, oil, tar, paint
  * supression agent: gas (halon), CO2, soda acid
* Class C
  * electrical equipment: computer, wiring, fuse box
  * supression agent:Gas (halon), CO2
* Class D
  * metals: magnesium, sodium
  * supression agent: dry powder
  
### Electricity

Sensitive equipment can be damaged or affected by various electrical hazards and anomalies, including:

* Electrostatic discharge (ESD)
  * The ideal humidity range for computer equipment is 40–60 percent
  * Higher humidity causes condensation and corrosion
  * Lower humidity increases the potential for ESD (static electricity).
  * A static charge of as little as 40V (volts) can damage sensitive circuits, and 2,000V can cause a system shutdown
  * The minimum discharge that can be felt by humans is 3,000V, and discharges of over 25,000V are possible
  * The ideal humidity range for computer equipment is 40–60 percent

* Electrical noise
  * This includes Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) and Radio Frequency Interference (RFI)
  * EMI is generated by the different charges between the three electrical wires (hot, neutral, and ground)
  * RFI is caused by electrical components, such as fluorescent lighting and electric cables
  * A transient is a momentary line noise disturbance

* Electrical anomalies 
  * Blackout: total loss of power
  * Fault: momentary loss of power
  * Brownout: prolonged drop in voltage
  * Sag: Short drop in voltage
  * Inrush: Initial power rush
  * Spike: momentary rush of power
  * Surge: Prolonged rush of power
  
## Site and Facility design

Astute organizations will involve security professionals during the design, planning, and construction of new or renovated locations and facilities. Proper site and facility requirements planning during the early stages of construction helps ensure that a new building or data center is adequate, safe, and secure - all of which can help an organization avoid costly situations later.

### Choosing a secure location

* Climatology and natural disasters
  * likelihood of hurricanes, floods, earthquakes
* Local consideration
  * high local crime?
  * nearby hazards, industrialized: air and noise pollution
* Visibility
  * will employees and facilities be targeted
  * nearby any other high visibility org that may attract undesired attention
  * keeping low profile is generally better
* Accessibility
  * local traffic patterns, road to airports, proximity of police/fire/medical departments
  * housing for employees
* Utilities
  * power grid, stable and clean?
  * telecoms
* Joint tenants
  * full access to all necessary environmental controls?
  * can/should noundary protection costs/responsibilities be shared between tenants?
  
### Desinging a secure facility

* Exterior walls
  * should withstand high wind (tornado, hurricane)
  * avoid windows, particulary on lower levels, where metal bars may be necessary
  * windows should be fixed and opaque
* Interior walls
  * meet fire codes and ratings
  * secure/restricted areas must have walls extend from floor to ceiling
  * kevlar walls to protect most sensitive areas
* Floors
  * raised flooring must be properly grounded
  * 150 pounds per square foot of bearing loads
* Ceilings
  * weight bearing and fire ratings must be considered
  * drop ceiling may conceal water leaks and intruders
* Doors and locks
  * must be sufficient strength
  * fire rating equivalent to walls
  * electronic lock mechanisms and other access control devices should fail-open in the event ot emergency
* Lightning
  * exterior lightning for all places should be sufficient
    * for personnel safety and to discourage intruders
* Wiring
  * all wiring, conduits, and cable runs must comply with building and fire codes and be properly protected
  * plenum cabling must be used below raised floors and above drop ceilings because PVC cabling releases toxic chemicals when burning
* Electricity and HVAC
  * req carefully planned to ensure succifient power and proper climate ranges
* Pipes
  * shutoff valves for water, steam, or gas pipes should be located and appropriately marked
  * drains should have positive flow; that is, carry drainage away from the building
