Physical (environmental) security controls include
* physical access controls
* technical controls
* environmental and life safety controls
* fire detection and suppression
* administrative controls

## Physical Access Contorls

### Fencing
* secure outside perimeter
* fences, gates, turnstiles and mantraps
* 3-4ft/1m = deter casual trespassers
* 6-7ft/2m = too high to clib easily
* 8ft/2.4m + barbed wire = deters more determined intruders
* mantrap
  * prevent more than one person passing through at once
  
### Security guards
Advantages
* Discernment
  * guards can apply human judgment to different situations
* Visibility
  * guards provide visible deterrent, response and control capability
* Dual functions
  * guards can also perform reception and visitor escort functions
  
Disadvantages
* Unpredictability
  * Pre-employment screening and bonding doesn’t necessarily assure reliability or integrity
* Imperfections
  * Along with human judgment comes the element of human error
* Cost
  * Maintaining a full-time security force (including training) or out-sourcing these functions can be very expensive
  
### Doges
Advantages
* provide a highly visible deterrent, response, and control capability
* acute sensory abilities (smell and hearing)

Disadvantages
* Limited judgment capability
* Cost and maintenance
* Potential liability issues

### Locks
Doors, windows, and other access points into secure or sensitive areas need to be protected
* Preset
  * basic mechanical locks that consist of latches, cylinders, and deadbolts; all require a key to open them
* Programmable
  * mechanical (such as dial combination or five-key pushbutton) or electronic (cipher lock or keypad)
  * shoulder surfing, a social engineering technique commonly used against these types of locks, involves casually observing an authorized individual entering an access code
* Electronic
  * utilize an electronic key (similar to the fancy keys found on expensive cars) that functions like a hybrid smart card (covered later in this section) and physical key
  
### Storage areas 
* Storage areas containing spare equipment and parts, consumables, and deliveries should be locked and controlled to help prevent theft
* be aware of any hazardous materials being stored in such areas and any environmental factors or restrictions that may affect the contents of the storage area

### Security badges (or access cards)
* used for identification and authentication of authorized personnel entering a secure facility or area
* a photo identification card (also referred to as a dumb card) is a simple ID card with a facial photograph of the bearer
  * no technology is embedded in these cards for authentication purposes, requiring that a security guard determines whether entry is permitted by the bearer
* Smart cards are digitally encoded cards that contain an integrated chip (IC) or magnetic stripe (possibly in addition to a photo). 

Various types of smart cards include
* magnetic stripe
  * most basic type of smart card
  * information is encoded in a magnetic stripe
  * Common examples include credit cards and automatic teller machine (ATM) cards
* optical-coded
  * similiar but more reliable than magnetic stripe card
  * Information is encoded in a laser-burned lattice of digital dots
  * These are becoming more common on U.S. state driver’s licenses
* Electric circuit
  * Contains printed electrical contacts on the card surface
  * These are true smart cards, commonly used for logical access control to computer systems
* Proximity card
  * Doesn’t require the bearer to physically insert the card into the reader
  * Passive
    * These devices contain no battery or power on the card
    * they use the electromagnetic field transmitted by the reader to transmit access information (identification) at different frequency levels
  * Field-powered
    * These devices contain active electronics, an RF transmitter, and power supply on the card
  * Transponders
    * Both the card and reader contain a transceiver, control logic, and battery
    * The reader transmits an interrogating signal (challenge) causing the card to transmit an access code (response)

### Biometric access controls
Only absolute method for positively identifying an individual
* Finger scan systems
* Hand geometry systems
* Retina pattern
* Iris pattern
* Voice recognition
* Signature dynamics

The accuracy is normally stated as percentage:
* False Reject Rate (FRR) or Type I error: Authorized users who are incorrectly denied access, stated as a percentage
* False Accept Rate (FAR) or Type II error: Unauthorized users who are incorrectly granted access, stated as a percentage
* Crossover Error Rate (CER): The point at which the FRR equals the FAR, stated as a percentage



## Technical Controls
Technical controls include monitoring and surveillance, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and alarms that alert personnel to physical security threats and allow them to respond appropriately.

### Surveillance
* visual surveillance systems
* when used to monitor or record = detective control
* visible use of these systems = deterrent control

### Intrusion detection
Not to be confused with IDS in network. This is physical.

* Photoelectric sensors
  * A grid of visible or infrared light is projected over the protected area. If a beam of light within the grid is disturbed, an alarm is sounded
* Dry contact switches and metallic tape
  * These systems are inexpensive and commonly used along a perimeter or boundary on door and window frames. For example, if the circuit switch is opened or the metallic tape broken, an alarm is sounded
* Motion detectors
  * Wave pattern
    * Generates a low frequency, ultrasonic, or microwave field over a protected area up to 10,000 square feet (3,000 square meters). Any motion changes the frequency of the reflected wave pattern, causing an alarm to be sounded
  * Capacitance
    * Monitors an electrical field for changes in electrical capacitance caused by motion. This type of motion detector is typically used for spot protection within a few inches of a protected object
  * Audio
    * Passive system (doesn’t generate a wave pattern or electrical field) triggered by any abnormal sound. This type of device generates more false alarms and should only be used in areas with low ambient noise
    
### Alarms

Alarms are activated when a certain condition is detected. Alarm systems should have separate circuitry and a backup power source. Line supervision, comprising technology and processes used to detect attempts to tamper with or disable an alarm system, should also be implemented.

* Local systems
  * An audible alarm is sounded on the local premises. These systems require a local response capability; that is, someone must call the police/fire department and/or respond directly
* Central station systems
  * These systems are operated and monitored by private security organizations connected directly to the protected site via leased lines.
* Proprietary systems
  * These are similar to central station systems but are operated and monitored directly on the premises
* Auxiliary station systems
  * use local municipal police or fire circuits to transmit an alarm to the appropriate police or fire headquarters
  * these systems are typically used in conjunction with one of the above systems (particularly central station systems) to improve response capabilities
* Remote station systems
  * These systems are similar to auxiliary station systems but don’t use police and fire circuits and also don’t necessarily send the alarm to a police or fire department
  * An automatic dial-up fire alarm that dials a local police or fire department and plays a prerecorded message is an example of a remote station system.


## Environmental and life safety controls

### Electrical power
* dedicated feeders from one or more utility substations or power grids
* emergency power off (EPO) switches near major systems and exit doors
* backup power source, f.e. diesel power generator
  * for critical facilities and systems
* UPS (uninterrupted power supply)
  * this is not a backup power source
  * designed for 5-30 min
* surge protectors/suppressors provide minimal protection for sensitive computer systems

Protective controls for ESD include:

* Maintain proper humidity levels (40–60 percent)
* Ensure proper grounding
*  Use anti-static flooring, anti-static carpeting, and floor mats
* Protective controls for electrical noise include
* Install power line conditioners
* Ensure proper grounding
* Use shielded cabling

### HVAC 
* Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning
* HVAC requirements planning involves complex calculations based on numerous factors including the average BTUs (British Thermal Units)
* ideal temperature range for computer equipment is between 50–80° F (10–26° C)
* temperatures as low as 100° F (38° C), magnetic storage media can be damaged
* The ideal humidity range for computer equipment is between 40–60 percent
  * Higher humidity causes condensation and corrosion
  * Lower humidity increases the potential for ESD or static electricity
* HVAC equipment should be dedicated, controlled, and monitored

## Fire detection and suppression

### Detection

* Heat-sensing
  * These devices either sense temperatures exceeding a predetermined level (fixed-temperature detectors) or rapidly rising temperatures (rate-of-rise detectors).  
  * The former are more common and exhibit a lower false alarm rate.
* Flame-sensing
  * These devices either sense the flicker (or pulsing) of flames or the infrared energy of a flame
  * These systems are relatively expensive but provide an extremely rapid response time.
* Smoke-sensing: These devices detect smoke, one of the by-products of fire. There are four types of smoke detectors:
  * Photoelectric: These sense variations in light intensity.
  * Beam: Similar to photoelectric by sensing when smoke interrupts beams of light.
  * Ionization: These detect disturbances in the normal ionization current of radioactive materials.
  * Aspirating: These draw air into a sampling chamber to detect minute amounts of smoke.

### Suppression systems
