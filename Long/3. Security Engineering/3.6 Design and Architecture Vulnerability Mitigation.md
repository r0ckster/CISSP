# Design and Architecture Vulnerability Mitigation
OS, apps, networks have vulnerabilities, which are open to compromise/exploitation. 

Vulnerability/pen tests id them and then you can address them. Otherwise system could be shutdown/overloaded with malicious data.

Basic concepts related to security architecture include the Trusted Computing Base (TCB), open and closed systems, protection rings, security modes, and recovery procedures.

## TCB - Trusted Computing Base
* total combination of protection mechanisms
  * HW, firmware, software > responsible for enforcing a sec policy
  * security perimeter is boundary that separates the TCB from the rest of the system

### Security kernel
* combination of hw, firmware and software elemenets in TCB that implements the reference monitor concept
  * reference monitor is a system component that enforces access controls on an object
* three requirements of a security kernel
  * mediate all accesses
  * be protected from modification
  * be verified as correct
  
## Security modes

Several security modes of operation, based on the classification level of information being processed on a system and the clearance level of authorized users, have been defined. These designations are typically used for U.S. military and government systems and include:

* Dedicated
  * All authorized users must have a clearance level equal to or higher than the highest level of information processed on the system and a valid need-to-know
* System High
  * All authorized users must have a clearance level equal to or higher than the highest level of information processed on the system but a valid need-to-know isn’t necessarily required
* Multilevel
  * Information at different classification levels is stored or processed on a trusted computer system (a system that employs all necessary hardware and software assurance measures and meets the specified requirements for reliability and security)
  * Authorized users must have an appropriate clearance level, and access restrictions are enforced by the system accordingly
* Limited access
  * Authorized users aren’t required to have a security clearance, but the highest level of information on the system is Sensitive but Unclassified (SBU)
  
## Recovery procedures
Security designs that protect a system during a hardware or software failure include:

* Fault-tolerant systems
  * systems continue to operate following failure
  * must be capable of detecting and correcting or circumventing a fault
* Fail-safe systems
  * when HW/SW failure detected, program execution is terminated, system is protected from compromise
* Fail-soft systems
  * when HW/SW failure detected, certain noncritical processing is terminated, and the computer or network continues to function in a degraded mode
* Failover systems
  * when HW/SW failure detected, the system automatically transfers processing to a hot backup component, such as a clustered server
  
 Common issues that require recovery include:
 * system reboot: unexpected/unscheduled event
 * system restart: automatically occurs when the system goes down and forces an immediate reboot
 * system cold start: results from a major failure or component replacement
 * system compromise: caused by an attack or breach of security
 
 
 ## Issues in security architectures
 
 ### Covert channels
 * unknown or hidden communications
 * take place within the medium of a legitimate communications channel
 
 ### Race conditions
 * software code in multiprocessing and multiuser systems, can result in critical errors that are difficult to find
 * most common race condition is the time of check to time of use bug caused by changes in a system between the checking of a condition and the use of the results of that check
  * two programs that both try to open a file for exclusive use might both open the file, even though only one should be able to

### Emanations
* unintentional emissions of electromagnetic or acoustic energy from a system can be intercepted by others and possibly used to illicitly obtain information from the system
* common form of undesired emanations is radiated energy from CRT (cathode ray tube computer monitor)
* third party can discover what data is being displayed on a CRT by intercepting radiation emanating from the display adaptor or monitor from as far as several hundred meters
* third party can also eavesdrop on a network if it has one or more unterminated coaxial cables in its cable plant

### Maintenance hooks
* hidden, undocumented features in software programs that are intended to inappropriately expose data or functions for illicit use

## Security countermeasures
Knowing that systems are subject to frequent or constant attack, systems architects need to include several security countermeasures in order to minimize system vulnerability

* Reveal as little information about the system as possible
  * don’t permit the system to ever display the version of operating system, database, or application software that are running
* Limit access to only those persons who must use the system in order to fulfill needed organizational functions
* Disable unnecessary services in order to reduce the number of attack targets
* Use strong authentication in order to make it as difficult as possible for outsiders to access the system
