## System self-protection

trustworthy operating system uses several mechanisms to protect itself
* memory segmentation
  * process isolation
  * security domains
  * virtual machines
* Layering and data hiding
  * levels of access to resources
  * protection rings
* protection techniques are performed by elements of the Trusted Computing Base (TCB)

## Protection Rings to isolate processes

An operating system protects itself by implementing virtual protection rings and placing components in each ring based upon trust levels.
* Ring 3
  * web browser, database, email client
* Ring 2
  * OS utilities, file system drivers
* Ring 1
  * OS
* Ring 0
  * OS kernel
  
## Segmentation to restrict resource access
Two levels of privilege (rings)
* Subjects of higher trust can access more system instructions and operate in privileged mode
* Controls (restrictions) must be placed on programs or processes that require Ring Zero privileges

## Reference Monitor Concept - Access Controls
* Reference Monitor 
  * Abstract machine that controls the access subjects have to objects
  * uses ACL to control the access to resources
  * Actions are logged and auditable
* Security Kernel 
  * Components in system that enforce and implement the rules of the reference monitor
  * A small security kernel is easy to verify, test, and validate as secure
    * in reality, kernel is usually bloated
    
    
## Reference Monitor - Control
* access controls found in operating systems and network access control systems
* validates a subject's access rights to resources to protect the object from unauthorized access or destructive modification
* an abstract machine (service) that mediates all access to objects by subjects
  * Evaluate subject's security clearance to object's (resources) security label
  * Implemented and enforced by the Security Kernel to protect objects
  * Reference monitor should ensure isolation, completeness and verifiability

* The reference monitor can be designed to use tokens, capability lists, or labels
  * Tokens
    * Communicate security attributes before requesting access
  * Capability lists
    * Offer faster lookup than security tokens but are not as flexible
  * Security labels
    * Used by high-security systems because labels offer permanence. This is provided only by security labels
    
`
Although the reference monitor is conceptual, the security kernel can be found at the heart of every system. The security kernel is responsible for running the required controls used to enforce functionality and resist known attacks. As mentioned previously, the reference monitor operates at the security perimeterâ€”the boundary between the trusted and untrusted realm. Components outside the security perimeter are not trusted. All control and enforcement mechanisms are inside the security perimeter.

## Open and Closed Systems

* Open Systems accept input from othere vendors
  * based on standard and practices, allow connection to differenet devices and interfaces
  * goal is to promote full interoperability
  * GSM, SIM
* Closed Systems are proprietary
  * generally locked and not based on open standards
  * lack interfaces to allow connection
  * Apple iPhone
  
## Process Isolation
* required to maintain high lvl of system trust, and to be certified as a multilevel security system
* prevents one process from spilling over into another process memory space > corrupting data
* performed by the OS
* sometimes done by means of VM (logical isolation)
* some systems require hardware isolation (physical isolation)
* Java uses a form of virtual machine because it uses a sandbox to contain code and allows it to function only in a controlled manner
