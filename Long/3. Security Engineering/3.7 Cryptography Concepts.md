# Cryptography Concepts

Cryptography (from the Greek, kryptos meaning hidden and graphia meaning writing) is the science of encrypting and decrypting communications to make them unintelligible for all but the intended recipient.


# Cryptography in Information Security

Cryptography can be used to achieve several goals of information security, including confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.

* Confidentiality
  * crypto protects confidentiality of info
  * encrypted info is basically useless without proper keys for decryption
* Integrity
  * crypto used to ensure integrity using hashing algorithms and message digests
* Authentication
  * crypto can be used for authentication (and non-repudiation) services through digital signatures, digital certificates, or a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)


# Cryptography Basics
Cryptography today has evolved into a complex science (some say an art) presenting many great promises and challenges in the field of information security. The basics of cryptography include classes and types of ciphers, various terms and concepts, and the individual components of the cryptosystem.

## Classes of ciphers
Ciphers are cryptographic transformations. The two main classes of ciphers are block and stream, which describes how the cipher operates on input data.

### Block ciphers
* operate on a single fixed block (usually 64 bits) of plain text to produce the corresponding ciphertext
* reusable keys, key management much easier
* interoperability, block ciphers more widely supported
* typically implemented in software

### Stream ciphers
* operate in real time on a continuous stream of data, typically bit-by-bit
* generally faster than block ciphers and require less code to implement
* keys usually used once, then discarded
  * key management serious problem
* typically implemented in hardware


## Types of ciphers

The two basic types of ciphers are substitution and transposition. Both are involved with the process of transforming plaintext into ciphertext.

### Substitution ciphers
* replace bits, characters, or character blocks in plaintext with alternate bits, characters, or character blocks to produce ciphertext
* classic example of a substitution cipher is one that Julius Caesar used: He substituted letters of the message with other letters from the same alphabet
* substitution cipher may be monoalphabetic or polyalphabetic:
  * Monoalphabetic: A single alphabet is used to encrypt the entire plaintext message
  * Polyalphabetic: A more complex substitution that uses a different alphabet to encrypt each bit, character, or character block of a plaintext message

A more modern example of a substitution cipher is the S-boxes (Substitution boxes) employed in the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm. The Sboxes in DES produce a nonlinear substitution (6 bits in, 4 bits out).

### Transposition (or permutation) ciphers
* rearrange bits, characters, or character blocks in plaintext to produce ciphertext
* in a simple columnar transposition cipher, a message might be read horizontally but written vertically to produce the ciphertext
  * the original letters of the plaintext message are the same; only the order has been changed to achieve encryption

DES performs permutations through the use of P-boxes (Permutation boxes) to spread the influence of a plaintext character over many characters so that they’re not easily traced back to the S-boxes used in the substitution cipher.

### Other types of ciphers

* Codes
  * Includes words and phrases
* Running (or book) ciphers
  * For example, the key is page 137 of The Catcher in the Rye, and text on that page is added modulo 26 to perform encryption/decryption
* Vernam ciphers
  * Also known as one-time pads, which are keystreams that can only be used once
* Concealment ciphers
  * These include steganography

Most modern cryptosystems use both substitution and permutation to achieve encryption.


## Key clustering

Key clustering (or simply clustering) occurs when identical ciphertext messages are generated from a plaintext message by using the same encryption algorithm but different encryption keys.

## The cryptosystem

A cryptosystem is the hardware or software implementation that transforms plaintext into ciphertext (or encryption) and back into plaintext (or decryption).

Effective cryptosystem must have:
* The encryption and decryption process is efficient for all possible keys within the cryptosystem’s keyspace
* The cryptosystem is easy to use
* The strength of the cryptosystem is dependent on the secrecy of the cryptovariables (or keys) rather than the secrecy of the algorithm. (Most cryptographic algorithms are public anyway.)

Cryptosystem comprise two elements:
* Cryptographic algorithm: This algorithm details the step-by-step procedures used to produce 
  * ciphertext (encipher)
  * plaintext (decipher)
* Cryptovariable
  * The key to the cryptographic algorithm, the cryptovariable is a secret value applied to the algorithm
  * The strength and effectiveness of the cryptosystem is largely dependent upon the secrecy and strength of the cryptovariable
  

*An analogy of a cryptosystem is a deadbolt lock. A deadbolt lock can be easily identified, and its inner working mechanisms aren’t closely guarded state secrets. What makes a deadbolt lock effective is the individual key that controls a specific lock on a specific door. However, if the key is weak (imagine only one or two notches on a flat key) or not well protected (left under your doormat), the lock won’t protect your belongings. Similarly, if an attacker is able to determine what cryptographic algorithm (lock) was used to encrypt a message, it should still be protected because you’re using a strong key (128 bit) that you have kept secret instead of a 6-character password written on a scrap of paper left under your mousepad.*

  
## Encryption and decryption
* Encryption (or enciphering) is the process of converting plaintext communications into ciphertext
* Decryption (or deciphering) reverses that process, converting ciphertext into plaintext
* Traffic on a network can be encrypted by using either end-to-end or link encryption


### End-to-end encryption
* packets are encrypted once at the original encryption source and then decrypted only at the final decryption destination
* advantage is speed and overall security
* BUT only the data is encrypted, not the routing information (so the packets can be properely routed)


### Link encryption
* requires that each node (for example, a router) has separate key pairs for its upstream and downstream neighbors
* packets are encrypted and decrypted at every node along the network path
* advantage is that the entire packet (even routing info) is encrypted
* disadvantages are 
  * latency, since packets must be encrypted/decrypted at every node
  * inherent vulnerability, if node is compromised or packets decrypted content cached in a node, message can be compromised

## The concept of non-repudiation
* to repudiate is to deny
* non-repudiation means that an action (such as an online transaction, e-mail communication, and so on) or occurrence can’t be easily denied
* related function of identification and authentication (I&A) and accountability
  * it’s difficult for a user to deny sending an e-mail message that was digitally signed with that user’s private key
  * it’s difficult to deny responsibility for an enterprise-wide outage if the accounting logs positively identify you (from username and strong authentication) as the poor soul who inadvertently issued the write-erase command on the core routers two seconds before everything dropped

## One-time pad
* a keystream that can only be used once
* considered unbreakable because it’s completely random and is used only once and then destroyed, it consists of a pad of the same length as the message to which it’s applied
* both the sender and receiver have an identical pad, which is used by the sender to encrypt the message and by the receiver to decrypt the message
* very effective for short messages but is impractical for larger (several megabytes) messages
* one-time pads are typically implemented as stream ciphers


## Plaintext and ciphertext

A plaintext message is a message in its original readable format or a ciphertext message that has been properly decrypted (unscrambled) to produce the original readable plaintext message.

A ciphertext message is a plaintext message that has been transformed (encrypted) into a scrambled message that’s unintelligible.


## Work factor: Force x effort = work!
* describes difficulty (in terms of time, effort, resources) that are required to break a cryptosystem
* cryptosystem can be broken
* goal of crypto is to achieve a work factor that sufficiently protects the encrypted information against a reasonable estimate of available time, effort, and resources
  * difficult because technology improves rapidly

*Moore’s Law is based on an observation by Gordan Moore, one of the founders of Intel, that processing power seems to double about every 18 months. To compensate for Moore’s Law, some really hard encryption algorithms are used. Today, encrypted information is valuable for perhaps only three months with encryption algorithms that will theoretically take several hundred millennia to break, confident in the knowledge that tomorrow it will be mere child’s play.*
