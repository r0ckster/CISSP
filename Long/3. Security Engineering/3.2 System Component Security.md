## Computer Architecture
- refers to structure of a computer system
- comprises hw, firmware and software

## Hardware
- physical components in a computer architecture
- usually CPU, memory and bus, but can include keyboards, monitors, printers etc.

### CPU
- The Arithmetic/Logic Unit (ALU)
  - ALU contains the electronic circuitry that executes all arithmetic and logical operations
  - As its name implies, the arithmetic/logic unit also performs logical operations
  - A logical operation is usually a comparison
  - The unit can compare numbers, letters, or special character
  - The computer can then take action based on the result of the comparison 
- Bus Interface Unit (BIU) 
  - Supervises data transfers over the bus system between the CPU and I/O devices
- Control Unit 
  - The control unit of the CPU contains circuitry that uses electrical signals to direct the entire computer system to carry out, or execute, stored program instructions
  - Like an orchestra leader, the control unit does not execute program instructions; rather, it directs other parts of the system to do so
  - The control unit must communicate with both the arithmetic/logic unit and memory
- Decode Unit
  - Converts incoming instructions into individual CPU commands
- Floating Point Unit (FPU)
  - Handles higher math operations for the ALU and control unit 
- Memory Management Unit (MMU):
  - Handles addressing and cataloging of data stored in memory
  - Translates logical addressing into physical addressing 
- Pre-Fetch Unit 
  - Preloads instructions into CPU registers
- Protection Test Unit (PTU) 
  - Monitors all CPU functions to ensure that they’re properly executed
- Registers
  - Registers are temporary storage areas for instructions or data
  - They are not a part of memory; rather they are special additional storage locations that offer the advantage of spee
  - Registers work under the direction of the control unit to accept, hold, and transfer instructions or data and perform arithmetic or logical comparisons at high speed
  - The control unit uses a data storage register the way a storeowner uses a cash register-as a temporary, convenient place to store what is used in transactions
  
``The basic operation of a microprocessor consists of two distinct phases: fetch and execute (it’s not too different from what our dog does: we throw the stick, and he fetches the stick). During the fetch phase, the CPU locates and retrieves a required instruction from memory. During the execute phase, the CPU decodes and executes the instruction. These two phases comprise a basic machine cycle that’s controlled by the CPU clock signals. Many complex instructions require more than a single machine cycle to execute.``

The four operating states for a computer (CPU) are:
1. Operating (or run) state: The CPU executes an instruction or instructions.
2. Problem (or application) state: The CPU calculates a solution to an application-based problem. During this state, only a limited subset of instructions ( non-privileged instructions) is available.
3. Supervisory state: The CPU executes a privileged instruction: that is, available only to a system administrator or other authorized user/ process.
4. Wait state: The CPU hasn’t yet completed execution of an instruction and must extend the cycle.

The two basic types of CPU designs used in modern computer systems are
1. Complex-Instruction-Set-Computing (CISC) 
  * Can perform multiple operations per single instruction. Optimized for systems in which the fetch phase is the longest part of the instruction execution cycle.
2. Reduced-Instruction-Set-Computing (RISC) 
  * Uses fewer, simpler instructions than CISC architecture, requiring less clock cycles to execute. Optimized for systems in which the fetch and execute phases are approximately equal.

Microprocessors are also often described as scalar or superscalar. A scalar processor executes a single instruction at a time. A superscalar processor can execute multiple instructions concurrently.

Finally, many systems (microprocessors) are classified according to additional functionality as follows (must be supported by the installed operating system):
* Multitasking: Alternates execution of multiple subprograms or tasks on a single processor
* Multiprogramming: Alternates execution of multiple programs on a single processor
* Multiprocessing: Executes multiple programs on multiple processors simultaneously

Two related concepts are multistate and multiuser systems that, more correctly, refer to operating system capabilities:
* Multistate: The operating system supports multiple operating states, such as single-user and multi-user modes in the UNIX/Linux world and Normal and Safe mode in the Windows world.
* Multiuser: The operating system can differentiate between users. For example, it provides different shell environments, profiles, or privilege levels for each user.

``An important security issue in multiuser systems is privileged accounts and programs or processes that run in a privileged state. Programs such as su
(UNIX/Linux) and RunAs (Windows) allow a user to switch to a different account, such as root or administrator, and execute privileged commands in this context. Many programs rely on privileged service accounts to function properly. Utilities are used to install fixes to the operating system or other applications.``

 ### Bus
 
The bus is a group of electronic conductors that interconnect the various components of the computer, transmitting signals, addresses, and data between these components. Bus structures are organized as follows:

* Data bus
  * Transmit data between CPU, memory and peripheral devices
* Address bus
  * Transmits addresses of data and instructions between the CPU and memory
* Control bus
  * Transmits control information (device status) between the CPU and other devices
  * A computer bus is not painted yellow, nor does it have red flashing lights and a stop sign
