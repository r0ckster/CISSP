Controlling access to media

-Librarian to controls access
-Log who takes what materials out and when
-Materials should be properly labelled
-Media must be properly sanitized when necessary (Degaussing / Physically destroying)


Protecting audit data and logs

-Intruders cover tracks by deleting logs
-Must make use of a central log server
-Log server must be hardened with restricted access
-Log server must be well protected to be reliable
	-Write once media
	-Signature tools such as syslogNG for reliability
-May be used in a trial
-Great fraud and investigation tools
-Requires some planning
-Protect your audit trail


Issues with log audit

-Quantity of log
-Event filtering in real time
-Clipping levels
-Finding good auditing tools t oreduce size of logs
-Developing procedures
-Train personnel on how to read logs
-Protect the logs
-User of proper integrity mechanisms
-Storage and preservation of logs



SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)

-seek to provide holistic view of an orgs IT security
-relevan data from single-point-of-view 

Some of the SIEM functions are listed below:

-Store RAW information from systems logs
-Aggregate logs in a single directory
-Will normalize the data in a common format
-May include alerting and reporting tools
-Often use for compliance requirements
-Great for incident response and investigation




Link Encryption

-Usually performed by ISP or site to site
-Encrypts all the data (headers and payload)
-Must decrypt at each node to route the packets
-Introduce a GAP at each of the decryption point
-A compromised node could lead to capture of data
-Provides confidentiality
-Hides addressing information
-Can be combined with end-to-end encryption
-IPSec in tunnel mode is a similar concept
-happens at lower layers, encrypts headers and trailers


End to end encryption

-Usually between users within an organization
-Only the data is encrypte
-Routing information is in clear text   
-No need to decrypt in transit or at each node
-Can be combined with link encryption
-IPSec is transport mode is a similar concept
-happens at higher layers and does not encrypt headers and trailers
