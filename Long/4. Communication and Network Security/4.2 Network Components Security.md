# Network Components Security

Implemented with various technologies, like FW, VPNs, IDS, remote access authentication mechanisms.

## Firewalls
* controls traffic between trusted network and untrusted public network
* can comprise hw, software or combination of both

### Firewall types

packet-filtering, circuit-level gateway and application-level gateway

#### Packet-filtering
* basic and inexpensive, suited for low-risk environment
* permits/denies traffic based on the TCP, UDP, ICMP and IP headers of the individual packets
* examines direction, source and destination IP/port numbers
* information is combined with predefined rules (ACL) > then determined if packet should be permitted or denied
* typically operates in Network or Transport layer (3 and 4)
* Advantages
  * inexpensive
  * fast/flexible
  * trasparent to routers
* Disadvantages
  * decisions based only on address and port info
  * no protection from IP or DNS spoof
  * doesn't support strong authentication
  * config/maintain ACL can be difficult
  * logging info may be limited
* more advanced packet-filtering FW is the dynamic packet filtering FW
  * supports using context-based access control (CBAC) or reflexive ACLs

#### Circuit-level Gateway
* controls access by maintaining state information about established connections
* when a permitted connection is established between two hosts, a tunnel or virtual circuit is created for the session, thus allowing packets to flow freely between the two hosts without the need for further inspecting individual packets
* operates at the Session Layer (5)
* Advantages 
  * speed, after connection is established, individual packets aren't analyzed)
  * support for many protocols
  * eaesy maintenance
* Disadvantages
  * Dependence on trustworthiness of the communicating users or hosts
  * Limited logging information about individual data packets is available after the initial connection is established
* stateful inspection FW captures data packets at Network Layer (3) and then queues and analyzes them at the upper layer

#### Application-level gateway
* Operates on the layer 7, processing data packets for specific IP applications
* generally most secure and commonly implemented as a proxy server
  * no direct communication between two hosts permitted
  * proxy analyzes and if permitted > send a copy of the original packet to the host
* Advantages
  * data not directly transmitted
  * can be used to implement strong user authentication in applications
* Disadvantages
  * reduces network performance
  * must be tailored for specific applications
