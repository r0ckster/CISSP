# Network Components Security

Implemented with various technologies, like FW, VPNs, IDS, remote access authentication mechanisms.

# Firewalls
* controls traffic between trusted network and untrusted public network
* can comprise hw, software or combination of both

## Firewall types

packet-filtering, circuit-level gateway and application-level gateway

### Packet-filtering
* basic and inexpensive, suited for low-risk environment
* permits/denies traffic based on the TCP, UDP, ICMP and IP headers of the individual packets
* examines direction, source and destination IP/port numbers
* information is combined with predefined rules (ACL) > then determined if packet should be permitted or denied
* typically operates in Network or Transport layer (3 and 4)
* Advantages
  * inexpensive
  * fast/flexible
  * trasparent to routers
* Disadvantages
  * decisions based only on address and port info
  * no protection from IP or DNS spoof
  * doesn't support strong authentication
  * config/maintain ACL can be difficult
  * logging info may be limited
* more advanced packet-filtering FW is the dynamic packet filtering FW
  * supports using context-based access control (CBAC) or reflexive ACLs

### Circuit-level Gateway
* controls access by maintaining state information about established connections
* when a permitted connection is established between two hosts, a tunnel or virtual circuit is created for the session, thus allowing packets to flow freely between the two hosts without the need for further inspecting individual packets
* operates at the Session Layer (5)
* Advantages 
  * speed, after connection is established, individual packets aren't analyzed)
  * support for many protocols
  * eaesy maintenance
* Disadvantages
  * Dependence on trustworthiness of the communicating users or hosts
  * Limited logging information about individual data packets is available after the initial connection is established
* stateful inspection FW captures data packets at Network Layer (3) and then queues and analyzes them at the upper layer

### Application-level gateway
* Operates on the layer 7, processing data packets for specific IP applications
* generally most secure and commonly implemented as a proxy server
  * no direct communication between two hosts permitted
  * proxy analyzes and if permitted > send a copy of the original packet to the host
* Advantages
  * data not directly transmitted
  * can be used to implement strong user authentication in applications
* Disadvantages
  * reduces network performance
  * must be tailored for specific applications
  
## Firewall architectures

The four basic types of firewall architectures are screening router, dual-homed gateway, screened-host gateway, and screened-subnet.

### Screening router
* the most basic type of firewall architecture employed
* external router placed between untrusted and trusted networks, and security policy implemented using ACLs

Advantages
* completely transparent
* relatively simple and cheap

Disadvantages
* difficult to config/maintain
* may have difficulties handling certain traffic
* limited logging
* no user authentication
* difficult to mask internal network structure
* doesn't truy implement a FW choke-point strategy

### Dual-homed gateways
* another common FW architecture
* system with two network interfaces that sits between untrusted and trusted network
* also known as "bastion host"
  * general term often used to refer to proxies, gateways, firewalls, or any server that provides applications or services directly to an untrusted networ
  * Because itâ€™s often the target of attackers, a bastion host is sometimes referred to as a sacrificial lamb
    * bastion host is typically a hardened system employing robust security mechanisms

Advantages
* operates in fail-safe mode
* internal network structure is masked

Disadvantages
* may inconvenience users
* proxies may not be available for some services
* may cause slower network performance


### Screened-host gateways
* employs an external screening router and an internal bastion host
* screening router is configured so that the bastion host is the only host accessible from the untrusted network (such as the Internet)
* bastion provides any required web services to the untrusted network
* Connections to the Internet from the trusted network are routed via an application proxy on the bastion host or directly through the screening router

Advantages
* provides distributed security between two devices
* transparent outbound access
* restricted inbound access

Disadvantages
* less secure because screening router can bypass the bastion host
* masking the internal network structure is difficult
* can have multiple single point of failure

### Screened-subnet
* perhaps the most secure of the currently designed firewall architectures
* employs an external screening router, a dual-homed (or multi-homed) host, and a second internal screening router
* implements the concept of a network DMZ (or demilitarized zone)
* Publicly available services are placed on bastion hosts in the DMZ

Advantages
* transparent to end users
* flexible
* internal network structure can be masked
* defense in depth

Disadvantages
* more expensive
* difficult to config/maintain
* can be difficult to troubleshoot



# Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)
* secure tunnel over a public network
* either encrypting or encapsulating the data
* client-to-VPN Concentrator (or device)
* Client-to-Firewall
* FW-to-FW
* Router-to-Router

## Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)
* developed my MS, to enalbe Point-to-Point Protocol over public network
* PPTP uses native PPP authentication and encryption services (such as PAP, CHAP, EAP)
* commonly used for secure dial-up connections using Microsoft Win9x or NT/2000 clients
* Data Link Layer 2

## Layer 2 Forwarding Protocol (L2F)
* developed by Cisco and provides similar functionality as PPTP
* Data Link Layer 2
* Permits tunneling WAN protocols like HDLC and SLIP

## Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)
* an IETF standard that combines Microsoft (and others) PPTP and Cisco L2F protocols
* for individual client-server connections
* Data Link Layer 2
* transparency, req no additional software
* robust authentication, supports PPP, RADIUS, TACACS, smart cards, one-time pw
* local addressing: the vpn entities rather than the ISP, assign IP addresses
* authorization, managed by the VPN server-side 
* accounting, both the ISP and user perform accounting

## IPSec -Internet Protocol Security
* an IETF open standard for VPNs that operates at the Network Layer 3
* most popular and robust VPN protocol
* ensures CIA by using Layer 3 encryption and authentication to provide end-to-end solution
* operates in two modes
 * Transport mode: only data encrypted
 * Tunnel mode: entire packet is encrypted
* two main protocols used in IPSec are
  * Authentication Header (AH): provides integrity, authentication and non-repudiation
  * Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP): provides confidentiality and limited authentication
* each pair of hosts communicating in an IPSec session must establish a security association
* security association (SA) is a one-way connection between two communicating parties; thus, two SAs are required for each pair of communicating host  
  * each SA only supports a single protocol (AH or ESP)
  * if both an AH and ESP are used between two communicating hosts, a total of four SAs is required
  * SA has three parameters that uniquely identify it in an IPSec session:
    * Security Parameter Index (SPI): The SPI is a 32-bit string used by the receiving station to differentiate between SAs terminating on that station
      * The SPI is located within the AH or ESP header
    * Destination IP address: The destination address could be the end station or an intermediate gateway or firewall, but must be a unicast address
    * Security Protocol ID: The Security Protocol ID must be either an AH or ESP association.
* Key management is provided in IPSec by using the Internet Key Exchange (IKE)

## SSL
* operates at the transport layer 4
* popular because of ease of use and low cost
* no special client hw or software required, web browser is enough
* little or no client configuration required
* user granted access to a specific application rather than to the entire private network
  * also its limitation
