# Network Protocol Security

## OSI Model
* 1984, International Standards Organization (ISO), Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Reference MOdel
* facilitate interoperability between network devices independent of the manufacturer
* defines standard protocols for communication - layered approach

  ### Layers

  ### Encapsulation and Decapsulation
  * data passed from highest layer (application, 7) downward through each layer to the lowest (physical, 1) (encapsulation)
  * \> then transmitted accross network to destination node
  * \> then passed upward from lowest to highest layer (decapsulation)
  * each layer communicates only with the layer above or below (adjacent layers)

## Physical Layer 1
* sends and receives bits across the network
* specifies electrical, mechanical and functional requirements of the network
  * topology, cabling and connectors, interface type, process for converting bits to electrical (or light) signals transmitted
* network topologies made from wires, cables, hubs
* adapter-to-adapter, transmission of bits, voltage levels, bits per seconds, conncetor dimensions, adapter interrupts
* Formats
  * RS-232, HSSI, X.21, EIA-449, Cat5/6, Coax, PCMCIA, USB
 
  ### Network topologies

    #### Bus
    * all devices connected to a single cable (the backbone) that's terminated on both ends
    * ideal for smaller networks = inexpensive, easy to install
    * impractical for larger environment = media have physical limitations, backbone is a single point of failure, tracing a fault could be difficult

    #### Star
    * each node connected directly to central hub
    * all data must pass through the hub > can become bottleneck / single point of failure
    * more expensive than Bus, because of additional HW (hubs) and cable lengths
    * ideal for larger environments, most common basic topology in use today
    * easy to install and maintain, network faults easy to isolate without affecting rest of the network

    #### Ring
    * closed loop connecting end devices in a continuous ring
    * functionally achieved by connecting devices to a Multistation Access Unit (MSAU or MAU)
    * common in token-ring and FDDI networks

  ### Analog and digital signaling
  * Analog signaling conveys information through a continuous signal by using variations of wave amplitude, frequency, and phase
  * Digital signaling conveys information in pulses through the presence or absence (on-off) of electrical signals

  ### Cable and connector types
  * cables carry electrical or ligth signals
  * signaling over cable medium is either baseband or broadband
    * baseband uses signle channel for transmission of digital signals, common in LANs using twisted pair cabling
    * broadband uses many channels for transmission of analog signals incl voice, video, data

    #### Three basic cable types
    * Coaxial cable
      * was very common in the early LAN days
      * consists of a single solid copper-wire core, surrounde by plastic/teflon insulator, braided metal shielding, metal foil wrap, all covered with plastic sheath
      * very durable and resistant to EMI and RFI signals
      * Thick
        * also known as RG8 or RG11 or thicknet, uses a screw-type connector, AUI - Attachment Unit Interface
      * Thin
        * also known as RG58 or thinnet, typically connected by a bayonet-type connector, BNC

    * Twisted pair cable
      * most popular LAN cable, light, flexible, cheap, easy to install
      * consists of copper-wire pairs that are twisted
      * seven classes, but only Cat-5, cat-5e and cat-6 cables typically used in networking
        * CAT-5, up to 100 Mbps, Fast Ethernet
        * CAT-5e, up to 1000Mbps @100 mhz, Gigabit
        * CAT-6, up to 1000Mbps @250 mhz, Gigabit
