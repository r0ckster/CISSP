* 1984, International Standards Organization (ISO), Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Reference MOdel
* facilitate interoperability between network devices independent of the manufacturer
* defines standard protocols for communication - layered approach

  ## Layers

  <img src="https://infosys.beckhoff.com/content/1033/tf6310_tc3_tcpip/Images/png/84433547__Web.png">

  ## Encapsulation and Decapsulation
  * data passed from highest layer (application, 7) downward through each layer to the lowest (physical, 1) (encapsulation)
  * \> then transmitted accross network to destination node
  * \> then passed upward from lowest to highest layer (decapsulation)
  * each layer communicates only with the layer above or below (adjacent layers)

# Physical Layer 1
* sends and receives bits across the network
* specifies electrical, mechanical and functional requirements of the network
  * topology, cabling and connectors, interface type, process for converting bits to electrical (or light) signals transmitted
* network topologies made from wires, cables, hubs
* adapter-to-adapter, transmission of bits, voltage levels, bits per seconds, conncetor dimensions, adapter interrupts
* Formats
  * RS-232, HSSI, X.21, EIA-449, Cat5/6, Coax, PCMCIA, USB
 
  ## Network topologies

  <img src="https://systemzone.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/network-topology.png">

    ### Bus
    * all devices connected to a single cable (the backbone) that's terminated on both ends
    * ideal for smaller networks = inexpensive, easy to install
    * impractical for larger environment = media have physical limitations, backbone is a single point of failure, tracing a fault could be difficult

    ### Star
    * each node connected directly to central hub
    * all data must pass through the hub > can become bottleneck / single point of failure
    * more expensive than Bus, because of additional HW (hubs) and cable lengths
    * ideal for larger environments, most common basic topology in use today
    * easy to install and maintain, network faults easy to isolate without affecting rest of the network

    ### Ring
    * closed loop connecting end devices in a continuous ring
    * functionally achieved by connecting devices to a Multistation Access Unit (MSAU or MAU)
    * common in token-ring and FDDI networks

  ## Analog and digital signaling
  * Analog signaling conveys information through a continuous signal by using variations of wave amplitude, frequency, and phase
  * Digital signaling conveys information in pulses through the presence or absence (on-off) of electrical signals

  ## Cable and connector types
  * cables carry electrical or ligth signals
  * signaling over cable medium is either baseband or broadband
    * baseband uses signle channel for transmission of digital signals, common in LANs using twisted pair cabling
    * broadband uses many channels for transmission of analog signals incl voice, video, data

    ### Three basic cable types
    * Coaxial cable
      * was very common in the early LAN days
      * consists of a single solid copper-wire core, surrounde by plastic/teflon insulator, braided metal shielding, metal foil wrap, all covered with plastic sheath
      * very durable and resistant to EMI and RFI signals
      * Thick
        * also known as RG8 or RG11 or thicknet, uses a screw-type connector, AUI - Attachment Unit Interface
      * Thin
        * also known as RG58 or thinnet, typically connected by a bayonet-type connector, BNC

    * Twisted pair cable
      * most popular LAN cable, light, flexible, cheap, easy to install
      * consists of copper-wire pairs that are twisted
      * seven classes, but only Cat-5, cat-5e and cat-6 cables typically used in networking
        * CAT-5, up to 100 Mbps, Fast Ethernet
        * CAT-5e, up to 1000Mbps @100 mhz, Gigabit
        * CAT-6, up to 1000Mbps @250 mhz, Gigabit
      * can be either unshielded (UTP) or shielded (STP)
        * UTP more common, because cheaper and easier to work with
        * STP used when RFI or EMI a concern
      * terminated with an RJ-type terminator: RJ-11, RJ-45, RJ-49
        * RJ-11 for analog phone lines
        * RJ-45 used for LAN
        * RJ-49 for ISDN/WAN
        
    * Fiber optic cable
      * most expensive and reliable, typically in backbone and high-availability (FDDI) networks
      * carries data as light signals
      * consists of glass core or bunde, glass insulator, kevlar fiber strands and PVC or teflon outer sheath
      * higher speeds, longer distances and resistance to interception and interference
      * terminated with SC, ST or LC-type connector
      
  ## Interface types
    Common interface standards include:
    * EIA/TIA-232: This standard supports unbalanced circuits at signal speeds of up to 64 Kbps (formerly known as RS-232).
    * EIA/TIA-449: A faster version of EIA/TIA-232, this standard supports longer cable runs and speeds of up to 2 Mbps.
    * V.24. CCITT: (Formerly ITU-T.) This standard is essentially the same as the EIA/TIA-232 standard.
    * V.35. CCITT: (Formerly ITU-T.) This standard describes a synchronous communications protocol between network access devices and a packet network with speeds of up to 48 Kbps.
    * X.21bis. CCITT: (Formerly ITU-T.) This standard defines the communications protocol between DCE and DTE in an X.25 network. It is essentially the same as the EIA/TIA-232 standard.
    * High-Speed Serial Interface (HSSI): This network standard was developed to address the need for high-speed (up to 52 Mbps) serial connections over WAN links.

  ## Networking equipment
    * operate at the Physical Layer 1
    * NICs (Network Interface Cards)
      * may be integrated to PC mobo or installed as adapter card (ISA, PCI, PC card)
    * Repeater
      * nonintelligent device that simply amplifies a signal to compensate for attenuation (signal loss) and extend the length of the cable segment
    * Hub
      * (or concentrator) is used to connect multiple LAN devices together, such as servers and workstations
      * Passive: Data enters one port and exits all other ports without any signal amplification or regeneration
      * Active:  Combines the features of a passive hub and repeater, also known as a multi-port repeater
    * Switch 
      * connects multiple LAN devices together
      * unlike hub, switch does not send outgoing packets to all devices, instead only to actual destination devices
 
 # Data Link Layer 2
 * ensures that messages are delivered to the proper device across a physical network link
 * defines the networking protocol
 * formats messages from layers above into frames for transmission, handles point-to-point synchronization and error control, and can perform link encryption
 * machine-to-machine, frame creation, error detection/correction, frame sequence, checksums
 * formats
  * ethernet, token-ring, ATM, FDDI, ISDN
* protocols
  * SLIP, PPP, ARP, RARP, L2F, L2TP
* consists of two sublayers, Logical Link Control (LLC) and Media ACcess Control (MAC)

## LLC (Logical Link Control)
* operates between the network layer above and the MAC sublayer below
* 3 functions
  * Provides an interface for the MAC sublayer by using Source Service Access Points (SSAPs) and Destination Service Access Points (DSAPs)
  * Manages the control, sequencing, and acknowledgement of frames being passed up to the Network Layer or down to the Physical Layer
  * Bears responsibility for timing and flow control
## MAC sublayer
* operates between the LLC sublayer above and the Physical Layer below
* responsible for framing and the following:
  * Performs error control:  cyclic redundancy check (CRC),  a simple mathematical calculation or checksum used to create a message profile
  * Identifies hardware device (or MAC) addresses
  * Controls media access
    * Contention: In contention-based networks, individual devices must vie for control of the physical network medium. This type of network is ideally suited for networks characterized by small bursts of traffic
    * Token passing: In token-passing networks, individual devices must wait for a special frame, known as a token, before transmitting data across the physical network medium. This type of network is considered deterministic (transmission delay can be reliably calculated and collisions don’t occur) and is ideally suited for networks with large, bandwidth-consuming applications that are delay sensitive
    * Polling: In polling networks, individual devices (secondary hosts) are polled by a primary host to see whether they have data to be transmitted. Secondary hosts can’t transmit until permission is granted by the primary host. Polling is typically used in mainframe environments.

## LAN protocols and transmission methods
* ARCnet
  * early LAN tech
  * transport data to the physical LAN medium, using token-passing media access method
  * implemented in a star topology by using coaxial cable

  * most common LAN protocol
  * implemented in a bus topology over coaxial or twisted pair cabling
* Token-Ring
  * transports data to the physical LAN medium by using the token-passing media access method
  * Originally developed by IBM, token-ring refers to both IBM Token-Ring and IEEE 802.5
  * All nodes are attached to a Multistation Access Unit (MSAU) in a logical ring (physical star) topology
  * One node on the token-ring network is designated as the active monitor and ensures that no more than one token is on the network at any given time
* Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI)
  * transports data to the physical LAN medium by using the token-passing media access method
  * implemented as a dual counter-rotating ring over fiber optic cabling at speeds up to 100 Mbps
  * All stations on a FDDI network are connected to both rings
    * During normal operation, only one ring is active
    
LAN data transmissions are classified as:
* Unicast
  * packets sent from source to single destination, using IP address
* Multicast
  * packets copied and sent from source to multiple destination devices, using special multicas IP address
* Broadcast
  * packets copied and sent from source to every device on destination network using a broadcast IP address
  
## WLAN technologies and protocols
* WLAN (wireless LAN) technologies function at the lower layers of the OSI Reference Model
* WLAN protocols define how frames are transmitted over the airlink
* WLAN networks were first encrypted with the WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) protocol, which was soon proven to be unsafe
* New standards of encryption include WPA (WiFi protected access) and WPA2


## WAN technologies and protocols
* WAN technologies function at the lower three layers of the OSI Reference Model
* WAN protocols define how frames are carried across a single data link between two devices
  * Point-to-Point links
    * provide single pre-established WAN comms path from customers network, accross a carrier network, to a remote network
      * Leased lines, transmission line reserved by a communications carrier for the exclusive use of a customer
      * Serial Line IP (SLIP), predecessor of Point-to-Point Protocol
      * Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), provides router-to-router and host-to-network connections over synchronous and asynchronous circuits
  * Circuit-switched networks
    * a dedicated physical circuit path is established, maintained, and terminated between the sender and receiver across a carrier network for each communications session
    * used extensively in telephone company networks and functions similarly to a regular telephone call
    * suited for always-on connections with constant traffic
      * Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)
        * communications protocol that operates over analog phone lines that have been converted to use digital signaling
        * ISDN lines are capable of transmitting both voice and data traffic
        * replaced by DSL
      * Digital Subscriber Lines (xDSL)
        *  uses existing analog phone lines to deliver high bandwidth connectivity to remote customers
  * Packet-switched networks
    * devices share bandwidth (by using statistical multiplexing) on communications links to transport packets between a sender and receiver across a carrier network
    * more resilient to error and congestion than circuit-switched networks
    * ideally suited for on-demand connections with bursty traffic
      * Frame Relay
        * standard protocol that handles multiple virtual circuits by using High-level Data Link Control (HDLC) encapsulation
      * Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)
        * very high-speed, low-delay technology that uses switching and multiplexing techniques to rapidly relay fixed-length (53-byte) cells containing voice, video, or data
        * ideally suited for fiber optic networks with bursty applications
* Other WAN protocols
  * Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC)
    * bit-oriented, full-duplex serial protocol that was developed by IBM to facilitate communications between mainframes and remote offices
  * High-level Data Link Control (HDLC)
    * bit-oriented, synchronous protocol that was created by the ISO to support point-to-point and multipoint configurations
    
## Networking equipment at the Data Link Layer 2
* Bridges
  * a semi-intelligent repeater used to connect two or more (similar or dissimilar) network segments
  * maintains an Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache containing MAC addresses
  * when receiving data signal > if destination MAC address in cache/local > data signal not forwarded
  * if MAC not local, the bridge forwards (and amplifies) the data signal to all connected network segments
  * broadcast storm, in which broadcast traffic is automatically forwarded by a bridge, causes serious networking problem (flooding a network)
* Swithces
  * an intelligent hub that uses MAC addresses to route traffic
  * transmits data only to the port connected to the destination MAC address
  * this transmission method creates separate collision domains (called network segments) and effectively increases the data transmission rates available on the individual network segments
  * can implement VLANs
  * traditionally consideret to be Layer 2 (data link)
  * newer switches can operate at Layer 3 (network) and 7 (application).
* Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) and Data Communications Equipment (DCE)
  * DTE, general term for user end of a user-to-network interface (such as computer)
  * DTE connects to DCE, which consist of devices
  * DCE provides physical connection to the network, forwards traffic and provides a clocking signal to sync transmission between DCE and DTE
  * DCE = NICs, modems..
  
## Asynchronous and Synchronous Communications
* Asynchronous communication
  * transmits data in a serial stream with control data (start and stop bits) embedded in the stream to indicate the beginning and end of characters
  * devices must communicate at the same speed, which is controlled by the slower of the two communicating devices
  * no internal clocking signal is used, parity bits are used to reduce transmission errors
* Synchronous communications
  * utilize an internal clocking signal to transmit large blocks of data, known as frames
  * characterized by very high-speed transmission rates
  
    
# Network Layer 3
* provides routing and related functions that enable data to be transported between systems on the same network or on interconnected networks or internetworks
* routing protocols defined at this layer: Routing Information Protocol (RIP), Open Shortes Path First (OSPF), Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
* Logical addressing of devices on the network is accomplished at this layer by using routed protocols, including the Internet Protocol (IP) and Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX)
* network-to-network, packet transmission, intermediate routing decisions, load adaptation, connection-oriented = X.25, connection-less = IP
* protocols: IP, ICMP, RIP, OSPF, BGP, IGMP

## Internet Protocol (IP)
* contains addressing information that enables packets to be routed
* documented in RFC 791 and is part of the TCP/IP protocol suite, which is the language of the Internet
* two primary responsibilities
  * connectionless: best-effort delivery of datagrams
  * fragmentation and reassembly of datagrams
* IPv4 
  * most commonly used
  * 32-bit logical IP address, divided into 4 8-bit sections (octets), consists of network number and the host number
  * Class A, large network, High-Order Bits: 0, Address range 1 to 126, Maximum hosts 16,777,214 (224-2)
  * Class B, medium network, High-Order Bits: 10, Address range 128 to 191, Maximum hosts 65,534 (216-2)
  * Class C, small network, High-Order Bits: 110, Address range 192 to 223, Maximum hosts 254 (28-2)
  * Class D, Multicast, High-Order Bits: 1110, Address range 224 to 239
  * Class E, Experimental, High-Order Bits: 1111, Address range 240 to 254
  * IP-ranges (10.x.x.x, 172.16.x.x and 192.168.x.x) reserved for use in private networks
    * these aren't routable on the Internet, thus often implemented on FWs/Gateways by using NAT (network address translation) to conserve IP addresses, mask the network architecture and enhance security
    * NAT translates private, non-routable addresses to registered IP when communication across the Internet is required
* IPv6 
  * uses 128-bit logical 
  * incorporates additional functionality to provide security, multimedia support, plug-and-play compatibility, and backward compatibility with IPv4
  * not yet widely implemented
  
## Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
* maps Network Layer IP addresses to MAC addresses
* ARP discovers physical addresses of attached devices by broadcasting ARP query messages on the network segment
* IP address to MAC address translations are then maintained in a dynamic table that is cached on the system

## Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP)
* maps MAC addresses to IP addresses
* necessary when a system, such as a diskless machine, needs to discover its IP address
* system broadcasts a RARP message providing its MAC address and requests to be informed of its IP address, RARP server replies with the requested information

## Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
* reports errors and other information back to the source regarding the processing of transmitted IP packets
* Common ICMP messages include Destination Unreachable, Echo Request and Reply, Redirect, and Time Exceeded
* The Packet Internet Groper (PING) is a popular utility that uses ICMP messages to test the reachability of network device

## Networking equipment at the Network Layer
* Routers
  * intelligent devices that link dissimilar networks and forward data packets based on logical or physical addresses to the destination network only (or along the network path)
  * consist of both hardware and software components and employ various routing algorithms (for example, RIP, OSPF, and BGP) to determine the best path to a destination based on different variables including bandwidth, cost, delay, and distance
* Gateways
  * Gateways are created with software running on a PC (workstation or server) or router
  *  link dissimilar programs and protocols by examining the entire data packet to translate incompatibilities
  
# Transport Layer 4
* provides transparent, reliable data transport and end-to-end transmission control
* hides the details of the lower layer functions from the upper layers
* functions:  
  * Flow control
    * manages data transmission between devices, ensuring that the transmitting device doesn’t send more data than the receiving device can process
  * Multiplexing
    * Enables data from multiple applications to be transmitted over a single physical link
  * Virtual circuit management
  * Error checking and recovery
    * Implements various mechanisms for detecting transmission errors and taking action to resolve any errors that occur, such as requesting that data be retransmitted 
* session-to-network interface, packetizes sessions messages, ensures reliable connection, transmits "Ack"
* protocols: TCP, UDP, SPX

## TPC (Transmission Control Protocol)
* TCP is a full-duplex, connection-oriented protocol
* provides reliable delivery of packets across a network
* requires a direct connection between two communicating devices before any data transfer occurs
  * accomplished via a three-way handshake
    * receiving device acknowledges packets and packets are retransmitted if an error occurs
* Connection-oriented, Reliable, Slow

## UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
* connectionless protocol
* provides fast best-effort delivery of datagrams across a network
* doesn’t guarantee delivery of transmitted packets (datagrams) and is thus considered unreliable
* doesn’t attempt to establish a connection with the destination network prior to transmitting data, acknowledge received datagrams, perform resequencing, and perform error checking or recovery
* DNS, SNMP, audio, video
* Connectionless, Best effort, Fast


TCP, Layer 4, Connection-oriented

UDP, Layer 4, Connectionless

IP (internet protocol), Layer 3, Connectionless

IPX (Internetwork Packet Exchange), Layer 3, Connectionless

SPX (Sequenced Packet Exchange), Layer 4, Connection-oriented


Simple Key Management for Internet Protocols (SKIP) is similar to SSL but doesn’t require prior communication to establish a connection or exchange keys


# Session Layer 5
* establishes, coordinates, and terminates communication sessions (service requests and service responses) between networked systems
* process-to-process, establishes comm link between processes, controls dialog (transmit/receive), sync (keep track of long msg), modes: Simplex, Half-Dublex, Full-Duplex
* Procotols: SSL, NFS, SQL, RPC

## Communication Session
* Connection establishment
  * initial contact between systems, agree upon parametes and protocols to be used and mode of operation
    * Simplex mode: In simplex mode, a one-way communications path is established with a transmitter at one end of the connection and a receiver at the other end. An analogy is an AM radio on which a radio station broadcasts music and the radio receiver can only receive the broadcast
    * Half-duplex mode: In half-duplex mode, both communicating devices are capable of transmitting and receiving but not at the same time. An analogy is a two-way radio in which a button must be pressed to transmit and then released to receive a signal
    * Full-duplex mode: In full-duplex mode, both communicating devices are capable of transmitting and receiving simultaneously. An analogy is a telephone with which you can transmit and receive signals (but not necessarily communicate) at the same time
* Data transfer
  * info is exchanged between devices/systems
* Connection release
  * after data transfer is completed, devices/systems systematically end the session
  
## Session Layer protocols
* Network File System (NFS): Developed by Sun Microsystems to facilitate transparent user access to remote resources on a UNIX-based network by using TCP/IP
* File transfer protocol (FTP): A program used to copy files from one system to another over a network
* Structured Query Language (SQL): Developed by IBM to provide users with a simplified method for defining its data requirements on both local and remote database systems
* Voice over IP (VoIP): VoIP transports various data types (such as voice, telephony, audio, and video) in IP packets providing major cost, interoperability, and performance benefits
* Remote Procedure Call (RPC): A client/server network redirection tool, Procedures are created on clients and performed on servers.


# Presentation Layer 6
* provides coding and conversion functions that are applied to data being presented to the Application Layer (Layer 7)
* These functions ensure that data sent from the Application Layer of one system are compatible with the Application Layer of the receiving system
* Process-to-Session interface (protocol conversion, data translation, Compression/encryption, character set conversion, graphics command inerpretation)
* Redirectors (file system, printers, networks)
* Formats: ASCII, EBCDIC, Encrypted, GIF, JPEG, MIDI, TIFF, Compressed

## Tasks associated with Presentation layer 6
* Data representation
  * Use of common data representation formats (standard image, sound, and video formats) enable application data to be exchanged between different types of computer systems
* Character conversion
  * Information is exchanged between different systems by using common character conversion schemes, such as Extended Binary-Coded Decimal Interchange Mode (EBCDIC) or American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII)
* Data compression
  * Common data compression schemes enable compressed data to be properly decompressed at the destination
* Data encryption
  * Common data encryption schemes enable encrypted data to be properly decrypted at the destination
