# Network Protocol Security

## OSI Model
* 1984, International Standards Organization (ISO), Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Reference MOdel
* facilitate interoperability between network devices independent of the manufacturer
* defines standard protocols for communication - layered approach

### Layers

1.Physical

### Encapsulation and Decapsulation
* data passed from highest layer (application, 7) downward through each layer to the lowest (physical, 1) (encapsulation)
* \> then transmitted accross network to destination node
* \> then passed upward from lowest to highest layer (decapsulation)
* each layer communicates only with the layer above or below (adjacent layers)

## Physical Layer 1
* sends and receives bits across the network
* specifies electrical, mechanical and functional requirements of the network
  * topology, cabling and connectors, interface type, process for converting bits to electrical (or light) signals transmitted
* network topologies made from wires, cables, hubs
* adapter-to-adapter, transmission of bits, voltage levels, bits per seconds, conncetor dimensions, adapter interrupts
* Formats
  * RS-232, HSSI, X.21, EIA-449, Cat5/6, Coax, PCMCIA, USB
 
### Network topologies

#### Bus
* all devices connected to a single cable (the backbone) that's terminated on both ends
* ideal for smaller networks = inexpensive, easy to install
* impractical for larger environment = media have physical limitations, backbone is a single point of failure, tracing a fault could be difficult

#### Star
* each node connected directly to central hub
* all data must pass through the hub > can become bottleneck / single point of failure
* more expensive than Bus, because of additional HW (hubs) and cable lengths
* ideal for larger environments, most common basic topology in use today
* easy to install and maintain, network faults easy to isolate without affecting rest of the network

#### Ring
* closed loop connecting end devices in a continuous ring
* functionally achieved by connecting devices to a Multistation Access Unit (MSAU or MAU)
* common in token-ring and FDDI networks

### Analog and digital signaling
* Analog signaling conveys information through a continuous signal by using variations of wave amplitude, frequency, and phase
* Digital signaling conveys information in pulses through the presence or absence (on-off) of electrical signals

### Cable and connector types
