# Network Attack Mitigation

Most attacks are DoS or DDoS. Others are...

## SYN flood
1. TCP packets requesting a connection (SYN) are sent to target with a spoofed source address
2. Target responds with SYN-ACK packet, but the spoofed source never replies
3. Half-open connections overwhelm a system resource while waiting for time out

* counterd by Cisco
  * TCP intercept, proxies for the half-opened connections
  * CAR - Committed Access Rate, limits the bandwidth available for certain types of traffic
* countered by Checkpoint
  * has a feature known as SYN Defender, similiar to Cisco's TCP intercept
* other defenses include changeing the default maximum number of TCP half-open connections
* reducing timeout period

## ICMP flood
* large numbers of ICMP packets (usually Echo Request) are sent to the target network to consume available bandwidth and/or system resources
* Because ICMP isnâ€™t required for normal network operations, the easiest defense is to drop ICMP packets at the router or filter them at the firewall

## UDP flood
* large numbers of UDP packets are sent to the target network to consume available bandwidth and/or system resources
* UDP floods can generally be countered by dropping unnecessary UDP packets at the router
* However, if the attack is using a required UDP port (DNS port 53), other countermeasures need to be employed

## Smurf
* variation of the ICMP flood attack
* ICMP Echo Request packets are sent to the broadcast address of a target network by using a spoofed IP address on the target network
* The target, or bounce site, then transmits the ICMP Echo Request to all hosts on the network
* Each host then responds with an Echo Reply packet, overwhelming the available bandwidth and/or system resources
* Countermeasures against Smurf attacks include dropping ICMP packets at the router

## Fraggle
* A Fraggle attack is a variant of a Smurf attack that uses UDP Echo packets (UDP port 7) rather than ICMP packets
* Cisco routers can be configured to disable the TCP and UDP services (known as TCP and UDP small servers) that are most commonly used in Fraggle attacks

## Teardrop
* In a Teardrop attack, the length and fragmentation offset fields of sequential IP packets are modified, causing the target system to become confused and crash.

## Session hijacking (Spoofing)

IP spoofing involves altering a TCP packet so that it appears to be coming from a known, trusted source, thus giving the attacker access to the network.

## Network Countermeasures
* ACLs, FW, IDS, AV, UTM (Unified Threat MAnagement)
* protection of network cabling
* Private addressing
* closing unnecessary ports/services
* security patches
* gateways - filtering intermediaries
