# Network Attack Mitigation

Most attacks are DoS or DDoS. Others are...

## SYN flood



## ICMP flood


## UDP flood


## Smurf



## Fraggle
* A Fraggle attack is a variant of a Smurf attack that uses UDP Echo packets (UDP port 7) rather than ICMP packets
* Cisco routers can be configured to disable the TCP and UDP services (known as TCP and UDP small servers) that are most commonly used in Fraggle attacks

## Teardrop

In a Teardrop attack, the length and fragmentation offset fields of sequential IP packets are modified, causing the target system to become confused and crash.

## Session hijacking (Spoofing)

IP spoofing involves altering a TCP packet so that it appears to be coming from a known, trusted source, thus giving the attacker access to the network.

## Network Countermeasures
* ACLs, FW, IDS, AV, UTM (Unified Threat MAnagement)
* protection of network cabling
* Private addressing
* closing unnecessary ports/services
* security patches
* gateways - filtering intermediaries
