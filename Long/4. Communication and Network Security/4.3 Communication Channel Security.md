# Communication Channel Security

# Wireless LAN security
* transmit data via electromagnetic waves, such as radio or light
* most common standard is 802.11
* FHSS - Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum
* DSSS - Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum
* FHSS and DSSS designed to maximize throughput while minimizing effects of interference
* 2.4 GHz band polluted
* 802.11 wireless NICs can operate in 4 mode
  * managed mode 
    * client mode
    * clients connect to ap, in client mode
    * once connected, client communicates with ap only
  * master mode 
    *infrastructure mode
    * used by wap
    * can only communicate with clients
  * ad hoc mode 
    * peer-to-peer mode with no central ap
    * pc with wired nic can advertise an ad hoc WLAN to allow Internet sharing
  * monitor mode
    * read-only mode used for sniffing WLANs
    * Kismet or Wellenreiter -tools use monitor mode to read 802.11 wireless frames
* 802.11i first 802.11 standard to provide reasonable security
    * RSN - Robust Security Network
      * allows use of WPA2 (Wifi Protected Access 2)
        * uses AES for confidentiality
        * CCMP (Counter Mode CBC MAC Protocol) to create MIC (Message Integrity Check) for integrity
      * WPA uses RC4 and TKIP, is better than WEP
      
## BluetoPersonal Area Network (PAN) wireless technologyoth
* Personal Area Network (PAN) wireless technology
* operates in 2.4 GHz

## WAP - Wireless Application Protocol
* designed to provide secure web services to handheld wireless devices
* based on HTML and includes HDML (Handheld Device Markup Language)

## RFID - Radio Frequency Identification
* technology used to create wirelessly readable tags for animals or objects
* There are three types of RFID tags: Active, semi-passive, and passive
* Active and semi-passive RFID tags have a battery; an active tag broadcasts a signal; semi-passive RFID tags rely on a RFID readerâ€™s signal for power

# Email, Web, Facsimile and Telephone security

## Email
* over 50 billion email sent every day, 85% of which is spam
* SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) used to send/receive email, uses port 25
* many vulns, many mail servers are configured to forward (or relay) all mail regardless sender/recipient is valid
* failing to secure smtp server = misuse of your server and bandwidth
  * will get you blacklisted by many orgs (RBL = Real-time blackhole list)
  * takes time to get removed from RBLs (months)
    * damage to your orgs comms and credibility
* risks if you fail to counter spam
  * failure of due diligence
  * missing/deleting important email.s
  * viruses and other malicious ocde
  * phising and pharming scams
  * SPIM (Spam over instant messaging), SPIT (spam over internet telephony)

### Email security tools
* secure servers and clients
* smtp servers should always be placed in DMZ
* unnecessary / unused services disabled, default relay settings changed
* implement spam filter
* never unsub or reply to spam e-mail = will confirm the legitimacy of your email address > further used/sold to other spammers
* dont send auto-reply message to Internet email addresses (if possible)
  * spammers know when youre on vacation then
* S/MIME, PEM, PGP
* av, encryption, digital signatures

# Web security
* HTTP (HyperText Transport Protocol) and HTML (HyperText Markup Language) make up the www
* script injection
  * inject scripting language commands into web form fields > web server sends the content of the back-end db to the hacker
* Buffer Overflow
  * hacker sends machine language instruction as part of queries to web servers in an attempt to run those instructions
    * if successful, hacker can execute commands of his own
* Denial of Service
  * crafted queries to a web server in order to cause malfunction
  * or huge volume of queries to clog web server

# Facsimile security
* fax transmission, can be easily intercepted or re-created
* Using cover pages (with appropriate routing and classification markings)
* Placing fax machines in secure areas
* Using secure phone lines
* Encrypting fax data

# PBX fraud and abuse
* one of the most overlooked and costly aspects of a corporate telecommunications infrastructure
* many employees use company telephone system for extended personal use
* publish and enfroce a corporate telephone use policy
* regular auditing of telephone records

# Caller ID fraud and abuse
* several methods to hide caller ID, may deliberately used to mislead or perpetrate fraud
* calling card
  * using a long distance calling card often masks the true origin of a call
* caller ID services
  * A number of commercial services are available that will generate any desired Caller ID
* Block Caller ID
  * Many wireline and wireless telephone services have means that can block Caller ID, either on a per-call basis or permanently
* Reconfigure your PBX
  * Often, a PBX that is connected via a trunk to a telephone network can send Caller ID data that is configured into the PBX
* VoIP
  * simple IP smartphone or PC sw can be used to generate false Caller ID data from VoIP phones
