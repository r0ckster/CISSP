# Communication Channel Security

# Wireless LAN security
* transmit data via electromagnetic waves, such as radio or light
* most common standard is 802.11
* FHSS - Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum
* DSSS - Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum
* FHSS and DSSS designed to maximize throughput while minimizing effects of interference
* 2.4 GHz band polluted
* 802.11 wireless NICs can operate in 4 mode
  * managed mode 
    * client mode
    * clients connect to ap, in client mode
    * once connected, client communicates with ap only
  * master mode 
    *infrastructure mode
    * used by wap
    * can only communicate with clients
  * ad hoc mode 
    * peer-to-peer mode with no central ap
    * pc with wired nic can advertise an ad hoc WLAN to allow Internet sharing
  * monitor mode
    * read-only mode used for sniffing WLANs
    * Kismet or Wellenreiter -tools use monitor mode to read 802.11 wireless frames
* 802.11i first 802.11 standard to provide reasonable security
    * RSN - Robust Security Network
      * allows use of WPA2 (Wifi Protected Access 2)
        * uses AES for confidentiality
        * CCMP (Counter Mode CBC MAC Protocol) to create MIC (Message Integrity Check) for integrity
      * WPA uses RC4 and TKIP, is better than WEP
      
## BluetoPersonal Area Network (PAN) wireless technologyoth
* Personal Area Network (PAN) wireless technology
* operates in 2.44 GHz

## WAP - Wireless Application Protocol
* designed to provide secure web services to handheld wireless devices
* based on HTML and includes HDML (Handheld Device Markup Language)

## RFID - Radio Frequency Identification
* technology used to create wirelessly readable tags for animals or objects
* There are three types of RFID tags: Active, semi-passive, and passive
* Active and semi-passive RFID tags have a battery; an active tag broadcasts a signal; semi-passive RFID tags rely on a RFID readerâ€™s signal for power
